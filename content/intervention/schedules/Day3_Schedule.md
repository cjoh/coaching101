## FACILITATOR NOTES

**Energy Management:**
- Morning: High intensity (role-plays are emotionally demanding)
- Post-lunch: Processing time (debrief is critical, not optional)
- Late afternoon: Celebratory closure with integration

**Emotional Safety Protocols:**
- **Pre-roleplay:** Establish clear stop signals ("pause," "time out")
- **During roleplay:** Facilitator monitors for overwhelm
- **Post-roleplay:** Immediate debrief, no one leaves triggered
- **Session 3.4 is mandatory:** Trauma-informed debrief is not negotiable

**Pedagogical Flow:**
- Morning: PRACTICE (live application of Days 1-2)
- Afternoon: PROCESS (trauma-informed integration)
- Closing: PREPARE (mentorship path and celebration)

**Critical Moments:**
- **11:30 AM Break:** First break after intense role-plays - participants need space
- **Extended Lunch:** 60 minutes intentional for emotional processing
- **Extended Break (2:45-3:05 PM):** 20 minutes after debrief before mentorship talk
- **Closing Ceremony:** Honor the vulnerability and growth of 3 days

**Materials Needed:**
- Role-play case packets (detailed scenarios)
- Observer rubrics (from Day 2 Assessment Tools)
- Trauma-informed debrief protocol
- Grounding exercise scripts
- Mentorship program handouts
- 40-week timeline documents
- Certification pathway maps
- Certificates of Completion
- Group photo setup
- Celebration refreshments (optional)

**Role-Play Management:**
- **Assign roles in advance** (Session 2.5 on Day 2)
- **Prepare participants mentally** (Session 3.2 - trauma-informed prep)
- **Rotate roles** so everyone plays interventionist at least once
- **Debrief immediately** after each scenario (5 min minimum)
- **Monitor for triggers** - facilitator watches for overwhelm
- **Stop if needed** - prioritize psychological safety over "finishing"

**Debrief Session (3.4) Structure:**
- Open space for emotions (normalizing)
- Name what was hard (validation)
- Identify triggers (self-awareness)
- Teach grounding techniques (practical tools)
- Close the container (transition out of role-play space)

**Closing Ceremony Best Practices:**
- **Honor vulnerability:** Participants took emotional risks
- **Acknowledge growth:** Name shifts observed over 3 days
- **Celebrate community:** The cohort bond is powerful
- **Provide clear next steps:** Mentorship starts soon
- **Leave space for silence:** Not everyone will share, and that's okay
- **End on hope:** Recovery work is hard and sacred

- Ends at 4:45 PM (vs. 5:30-5:45 PM on Days 1-2)

- Honors the intensity of the work

**Why extended breaks:**
- 20-minute break after trauma debrief (vs. typical 15 min)

- Extended lunch for emotional integration
- Longer break prevents re-traumatization

**Why closing ceremony is longer:**
