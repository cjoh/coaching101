- Distribute role cards (one per participant)
- Give participants time to read and embody their character
- Review facilitator notes

**Day 3, Session 3.1** (9:00-10:30 AM): Live Family Case Simulation
- Run full intervention roleplay
- Facilitator observes and takes notes
- Other participants observe using observation rubric

**Day 3, Session 3.2** (10:45-12:15 PM): Group Debrief
- Process emotional experience
- Analyze what worked/what didn't
- Connect to Intervention Continuum framework
- Discuss ethical considerations

### **Facilitator Preparation:**

1. **Choose which case study** based on what intervention mode you want participants to practice (or use multiple cases for different groups)

2. **Read complete family background** thoroughly before Day 2

3. **Print role cards** (one per participant, plus Pivot Person role)

4. **Prepare space** for simulation (private, comfortable, chairs in circle)

5. **Brief participants** on expectations:
   - Stay in role during simulation
   - It's okay to pause if needed
   - Debrief will happen afterward (process emotions there)
   - Goal is learning, not performance

## FACILITATOR NOTES FOR SIMULATION

### **Setup** (Before Simulation Begins):
- Chairs in circle (Carlos in center, family around, interventionist facing Carlos)
- Review "Collaborative Invitation" mode with participants playing family (They know Carlos is coming, this is NOT a surprise)
- Brief participant playing Carlos: "You're ambivalent. Part of you wants help. Part of you is scared. Listen to your family. Ask questions. Don't commit too quickly‚Äîmake the interventionist work for it."

### **Anticipated Challenges**:

1. **Carlos may become defensive**
   - Interventionist response: "I hear you feeling defensive. That makes sense. This is hard to hear. Take a breath. Let's keep listening."

2. **Family may blame or attack**
   - Interventionist response: "Let's remember we're here because we care about Carlos. Can you share how this affects YOU rather than what Carlos did wrong?"

3. **Abuela (if included) may minimize**
   - Interventionist response: "I hear that you want to protect Carlos. That comes from love. And what we're learning is that sometimes protecting can unintentionally help the disease continue."

4. **Carlos may ask: "What if I just cut back?"**
   - Interventionist response: "That's a great question. Have you been able to cut back and sustain it before? What happened?"

5. **Carlos may say: "I need time to think about it"**
   - Interventionist response: "I understand wanting time. And here's what we know: the disease of addiction often uses 'I need more time' to stay in control. Your family has researched options. There's a bed available now. What would need to happen for you to say yes today?"

### **Success Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Carlos listens to impact statements without walking out
- ‚úÖ Carlos asks questions about treatment (shows curiosity)
- ‚úÖ Carlos expresses fear or vulnerability
- ‚úÖ Interventionist uses reflective listening and MI techniques
- ‚úÖ Family stays in "I" statements and avoids blame
- ‚úÖ Treatment options presented collaboratively (not as ultimatum)

### **Debrief Questions** (After Simulation):
1. **To Carlos**: "What was that like to hear from your family? What surprised you?"
2. **To Family**: "How did it feel to share your impact? What was hard?"
3. **To Interventionist**: "What were your decision points? When did you feel stuck?"
4. **To Observers**: "What did you notice? What worked well? What would you do differently?"
5. **To All**: "How did this demonstrate Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation)? Where did we see invitation? Where did we see structure?"

3. **To Interventionist**: "How did you navigate Jennifer's denial? What techniques worked?"
4. **To All**: "How did this demonstrate Mode 2 (Structured Invitation)? Where was the structure? Where was the invitation?"

## FACILITATOR NOTES FOR SIMULATION

### **Setup**:
- Hospital setting (chairs arranged to simulate ER room: David in bed/chair, Linda nearby, interventionist standing/sitting close)
- THIS IS A CRISIS. Energy should feel urgent but not chaotic.
- Brief participant playing David: "You're physically sick (withdrawal), emotionally raw, ashamed, but briefly open. You're exhausted and out of options. When interventionist and mom offer help, you say yes‚Äînot enthusiastically, but with resignation and hope."

### **Anticipated Challenges**:

1. **David may be shut down emotionally**
   - Interventionist response: "I know you're exhausted. I'm not going to push you. I just want to understand what you want to be different."

2. **David may say: "I've tried before. It didn't work."**
   - Interventionist response: "Tell me about those times. What was different then? What would need to be different this time?"

3. **David may say: "I don't deserve help."**
   - Interventionist response: "I hear shame in what you're saying. You deserve recovery. Everyone does. Your mom is here because she believes that too."

4. **Linda may be emotional (crying, overwhelming David)**
   - Interventionist response: "Linda, I can see how much you love David. Let's take a breath. David, your mom's here because she doesn't want to lose you."

### **Success Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ David engages (answers questions, doesn't shut down)
- ‚úÖ Interventionist uses MI techniques (open questions, reflective listening)
- ‚úÖ Linda expresses love AND sets healthy choice
- ‚úÖ Treatment presented as immediate option (urgency appropriate to crisis)
- ‚úÖ David agrees to go (even if ambivalently)

### **Debrief Questions**:
1. **To David**: "What was it like to be in crisis and have someone show up with a plan? What helped you say yes?"
2. **To Linda**: "How did you balance expressing love with setting a healthy choice?"
3. **To Interventionist**: "How did you navigate the urgency of the crisis while respecting David's autonomy? What was your internal process?"
4. **To All**: "How did this demonstrate Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc Crisis Response)? What was different from Mode 1 or Mode 2?"

**Goal**: Prepare participants to roleplay a full intervention simulation on Day 3

**Process**:

1. **Choose Case Study** (5 minutes)
   - If small group (8-12): Use ONE case study
   - If larger group (15-20): Split into 2-3 groups, use multiple case studies

2. **Assign Roles** (10 minutes)
   - Pivot Person: Choose someone comfortable with vulnerability
   - Family members: Distribute based on participant count
   - Interventionist: Choose someone with coaching/facilitation experience (or more experienced participant)
   - Observers: Anyone not in a role uses observation rubric

3. **Distribute Role Cards** (5 minutes)
   - One role card per participant
   - Extra copies of full case background for interventionist and observers

4. **Reading & Embodiment Time** (30 minutes)
   - Participants read role cards silently
   - Encourage: "Think about your character. What motivates them? What are they feeling?"
   - Interventionist: Review intervention plan and facilitator notes

5. **Q&A and Logistics** (15 minutes)
   - Answer questions about roles, logistics, expectations
   - Clarify: "Tomorrow we'll run the full simulation. Tonight, let your character simmer. Think about what it would be like to be this person."

6. **Homework** (5 minutes)
   - If playing family member: Write your impact statement (expand on what's in role card)
   - If playing interventionist: Review Intervention Continuum Module, plan opening and facilitation approach
   - If observing: Review observation rubric

3. **Run Simulation** (60-90 minutes)
   - Let it unfold naturally
   - Facilitator observes, takes notes, does NOT interrupt (unless safety issue)
   - Observers use rubric to track what's happening

4. **Post-Simulation Pause** (5 minutes)
