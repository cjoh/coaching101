This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the requirements document for the **Core Values Interventionist Training** program—a 3-day training plus 40-week mentorship program for professional interventionists. The document defines the philosophy, curriculum structure, learning objectives, and certification requirements for this advanced professional module within the Core Values Recovery system.

## Core Values Recovery Philosophy

When working with content in this repository, understand the foundational principles:

- **Intervention Definition**: A guided process of connection bringing together people, information, resources, and actions to help someone move from crisis to recovery
- **Recovery Philosophy**: Recovery is lifelong—reclaiming connection to values, meaning, and purpose
- **Core Approach**: Invitation over coercion, collaboration over control, dignity and respect as foundational

## Key Language & Terminology

The Core Values Recovery system uses specific terminology that must be preserved:

- **"Pivot Person"** (not "person of concern" or "addict")
- **"Healthy Choices"** (not "boundaries")
- **"Recovery is a Team Sport"** (collaborative systems language)
- **Three Pillars**: Awareness, Coordination, Care
- **Connection**: Both process and outcome

When editing or expanding content, maintain this values-based, invitational tone and avoid:
- Clinical jargon
- Coercive language
- Blame-oriented framing

## Content Structure

The document follows this architecture:

1. **Overview & Philosophy**: Guiding definitions and what makes Core Values different
2. **Learning Objectives**: 10 competencies participants will achieve
3. **Facilitator Manual Requirements**: Structure for trainer delivery
4. **Participant Manual Requirements**: Workbook and reference components
5. **3-Day Training Schedule**: Day-by-day curriculum (Awareness → Coordination → Care)
6. **40-Week Mentorship Model**: Post-training supervision structure
7. **Certification Path**: Requirements for Core Values Interventionist and Master Coach certifications
8. **Design & Style Guidelines**: Visual identity and tone standards

## Design Standards

When creating related materials or expanding this document:

- **Color Palette**: Navy (#1d4486), white, gold (#D4AA4C)
- **Typography**: Bebas Neue (headings), Roboto Condensed (body)
- **Visual Style**: Spacious, minimalist, modern with bas-relief Core Values symbols (Integrity, Humility, Service, Connection)
- **Tone**: Invitational, values-based, collaborative—balancing humanity of recovery with clarity of systems work

## Professional Distinctions

The training emphasizes clear boundaries between professional roles:

- **Interventionist**: Guides families through crisis to connection, coordinates care network, no financial interest in outcomes
- **Coach**: Ongoing support and accountability
- **Therapist**: Clinical treatment and diagnosis
- **Sponsor**: Peer-based 12-step guidance
- **Peer Professional**: Certified peer support

When discussing intervention content, respect these distinctions and avoid role confusion.
