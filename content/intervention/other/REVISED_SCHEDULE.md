## BREAK PHILOSOPHY

**Adult Learning Principles:**
- Biological needs: Bladder, hunger, blood sugar
- Cognitive needs: Processing time, consolidation
- Social needs: Connection, networking, questions
- Physical needs: Movement, stretching, fresh air

**Break Guidelines:**
- **15-minute breaks:** Every 75-90 minutes
- **5-minute micro-breaks:** Built into 90+ minute sessions (stand, stretch, pair-share)
- **60-minute lunches:** Time to eat, digest, decompress, network
- **20-minute extended break:** After emotionally heavy content (Day 3)

**Energy Management:**
- Morning: Cognitive work (concepts, frameworks)
- Post-lunch: Interactive work (practice, discussion)
- Late afternoon: Integration, reflection, lighter content

---

## COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT

**Day 1:** 4-5 new concepts (intervention definition, recovery, systems thinking, language)
**Day 2:** 5-7 new concepts (roles, 5 modes, assessment framework, 5 tools)
**Day 3:** 2-3 new concepts (trauma-informed practice, ethics) + APPLICATION of Days 1-2

**Rationale:**
- Research shows adults can integrate 3-5 new concepts per day
- Day 2 is at upper limit but includes practice (active learning)
- Day 3 is primarily application, not new learning

---

## ACTIVITY BALANCE

**Each day includes:**
- 30% Presentation/Lecture (new content)
- 30% Guided Practice (worksheets, mapping, writing)
- 20% Interactive Practice (pairs, small groups, roleplay)
- 20% Reflection/Integration (solo and community)

**Movement Built In:**
- Language Workshop: Standing practice
- Tool Practice: Paired activities (requires moving to partner)
- Roleplays: Physical movement inherent
- Micro-breaks: Structured stand/stretch moments

---

## TOTAL TIME ALLOCATION

| Category | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Total |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Instruction** | 4.5h | 4.5h | 3.0h | 12h |
| **Practice** | 1.5h | 2.0h | 3.5h | 7h |
| **Reflection** | 1.0h | 0.5h | 1.0h | 2.5h |

---

## ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS

**Formative Assessment (Throughout):**
- Day 1: "Exit ticket" - One concept that needs clarification
- Day 2 AM: Quick quiz on 5 modes (verbal, no grades)
- Day 2 PM: Tool practice observation (trainer circulates)
- Day 3: Roleplay performance (informal feedback)

**Summative Assessment:**
- Portfolio submitted during mentorship (not during 3-day training)
- Certification based on mentorship completion

---

## TRAINER NOTES

### Pacing Flexibility

**If Running Behind:**
- Shorten reflection time (not practice time)
- Reduce Q&A (capture questions for breaks)
- Skip optional examples (keep core content)

**If Running Ahead:**
- Extend practice time (never a waste)
- Add small group discussions
- Answer parking lot questions
- Do NOT start next session early (respect break time)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping breaks:** "We're on a roll, let's keep going" â†’ NO. Breaks are non-negotiable.
2. **Overexplaining:** Provide just-in-time information, not everything at once
3. **Passive lecture:** If you're talking >15 minutes straight, add interaction
4. **Rushing practice:** Practice is where learning happens; never rush it
5. **Ignoring energy:** If group is flagging, add movement/pairs/standing activity

## COMPARISON: ORIGINAL vs. REVISED

### Key Improvements

| Issue | Original | Revised | Impact |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Session 2.3 (Continuum)** | 2 hours straight | Split: 60m + 30m with breaks | Reduced cognitive overload |
| **Day 2 Lunch** | 30 minutes | 60 minutes | Biological needs met |
| **Session 2.4 (Tools)** | 11 tools overview (8m each) | 5 tools deep dive (18m each) | Mastery vs. exposure |
| **Tool Practice** | Day 3 only (18h gap) | Same day as intro | Better retention |
| **Session 3.3 (Roleplays)** | 2.5 hours straight | Split: 75m + 60m with break | Physical/emotional sustainability |
| **Ethics Placement** | Day 3 (after roleplays) | Day 2 (with boundaries) | Informs practice |
| **Trauma Content** | After roleplays | Before AND after | Safety framework + processing |
| **Total Breaks** | 4 breaks/day | 5-6 breaks/day | Energy management |

### Time Reallocated

**Gained Time From:**
- Reduced Session 1.6 reflection (60m â†’ 40m): +20m
- Consolidated Ethics into Session 2.2: Saves dedicated session
- Streamlined 11 tools to 5 tools deep dive: More efficient use of 90m

**Invested Time Into:**
- Proper breaks (3-4 â†’ 5-6 per day): +45m/day
- Extended lunches (30m â†’ 60m): +30m Day 2, +15m Day 3
- Tool practice (added to Day 2): Already within 90m session
- Trauma content before roleplays: +15m

**Net Result:** Better pacing, same 21 contact hours

---

## CONCLUSION

This revised schedule:
- âœ… Honors adult learning biology (breaks, lunch, movement)
- âœ… Manages cognitive load (fewer concepts, more depth)
- âœ… Builds in practice (same day as learning)
- âœ… Sequences logically (trauma before roleplays, ethics with boundaries)
- âœ… Maintains 21 contact hours
- âœ… Improves retention and engagement
- âœ… Prevents trainer and participant burnout

**This is a sustainable, effective training that participants will remember and apply.**
