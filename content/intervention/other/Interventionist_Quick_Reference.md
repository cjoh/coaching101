## 📋 CHEAT SHEET 1: THE CORE VALUES FRAMEWORK

### **What Is an Intervention?**
A guided process of connection – bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move away from crisis and toward recovery.

### **What Is Recovery?**
A lifelong process of reclaiming your connection to your values, meaning, and purpose—usually from a loss caused by addiction.

### **The Three Pillars**:
1. **🔍 AWARENESS** — Recognizing disease, enabling patterns, family roles, self-limitations
2. **🤝 COORDINATION** — Mobilizing the network, coordinating the care team
3. **⚕️ CARE** — Expressing care through action, dignity, follow-through, self-care

### **Core Values of an Intervention**:
- 🤝 Dignity, respect, and invitation over coercion and control
- 🔗 Connection as both process and outcome
- 🌐 "The recovery belongs to the whole system"
- ⚖️ The three pillars: Awareness, Coordination, Care
- 💎 Core Values lens: integrity, humility, and service

## 🗣️ CHEAT SHEET 2: LANGUAGE GUIDE

### **Say THIS, Not THAT**:

| ❌ AVOID | ✅ USE INSTEAD | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Addict, alcoholic | **Pivot Person** | Humanizes, emphasizes shared movement |
| Person of concern | **Pivot Person** | Acknowledges pivot point for whole family |
| Boundaries | **Healthy Choices** | Empowerment, agency, self-leadership |
| You're enabling | **"We've been helping in the wrong ways"** | Reduces defensiveness, inclusive language |
| Tough love | **Invitation over coercion** | Centers dignity |
| Co-dependency | **"Recovery is a team sport"** | Collaboration, not pathologizing |
| He's going to treatment or else | **"We're offering treatment. Here's what we've learned."** | Invitation, not ultimatum |

### **Person-First Language**:
- ❌ "He's an addict" → ✅ "He's a person struggling with addiction"
- ❌ "She's a drunk" → ✅ "She has alcohol use disorder"

## 👥 CHEAT SHEET 3: ROLE DISTINCTIONS

| Role | Works FOR | Focus | Time Frame |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Interventionist** | Family/Network | Crisis → connection, coordination | Time-limited (weeks) |
| **Peer Coach** | Pivot Person | Growth, accountability, community | Ongoing (months) |

| **Therapist** | Individual | Trauma, diagnosis, clinical treatment | Variable |
| **Sponsor** | Sponsee | 12-step work, peer mentorship | Ongoing (years) |

### **Key Distinctions**:

## 🌈 CHEAT SHEET 4: THE INTERVENTION CONTINUUM™

### **The 5 Modes**:

```
←────────────────────────────────────────→
MOST INVITATIONAL ← → MOST STRUCTURED
←────────────────────────────────────────→

MODE 1          MODE 2        MODE 3       MODE 4    MODE 5
Collaborative   Structured    Planned      Ad-Hoc   Individual
Invitation      Invitation    Surprise    (Crisis)
```

### **Quick Mode Selector**:

**Mode 1** — Collaborative Invitation (ARISE/CRAFT-based)
- **When**: Contemplation/Preparation, Relational Capacity ≥7, Safety ≤6
- **How**: Pivot Person invited from start, transparent, multiple meetings

**Mode 2** — Structured Invitation (LoveFirst/Storti-based)

- **When**: Safety 9-10, Crisis window (OD, arrest, hospitalization)
- **How**: Rapid coordination, leverage natural consequences, MI techniques

**Mode 5** — Individual (MI-based)

## 📊 CHEAT SHEET 5: ASSESSMENT QUICK GUIDE

### **3-Factor Assessment**:

**1. SAFETY/URGENCY** (0-10):
- 0-4: LOW → Mode 1, 5
- 5-6: MODERATE → Mode 1, 2, 5
- 7-8: HIGH → Mode 2, 3
- 9-10: EMERGENCY → Mode 4

**2. READINESS LEVEL**:
- **Precontemplation** (denial) → Mode 2, 3, 4
- **Contemplation** (ambivalent) → Mode 1, 2, 5
- **Preparation** (planning) → Mode 1, 5

**3. RELATIONAL CAPACITY** (0-10):
- 0-4: FRACTURED → Mode 5, (Mode 3 if crisis)
- 5-6: STRAINED → Mode 2, 3, 5
- 7-10: FUNCTIONAL/STRONG → Mode 1, 2

### **Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF Safety = 9-10 → MODE 4 (Emergency)
ELSE IF Safety ≤6 AND Readiness ≥Contemplation AND Relational ≥7 → MODE 1
ELSE IF Safety 5-7 AND Readiness = Precontemplation → MODE 2 or 3
ELSE IF Relational ≤4 OR Family unavailable → MODE 5
ELSE Consult supervisor
```

## ⚖️ CHEAT SHEET 6: ETHICS CHECKPOINT

### **The Four Questions** (Answer YES to all before proceeding):

1. ☐ Is this rooted in **LOVE** (not control)?
2. ☐ Am I respecting **DIGNITY** of all?
3. ☐ Is the **FAMILY** committed to their recovery?
4. ☐ No **FINANCIAL CONFLICT** of interest?

**If ANY answer is NO → Stop. Consult supervisor.**

### **Red Flags — DO NOT PROCEED**:
- 🚫 Family motivated by punishment/revenge
- 🚫 No follow-up support plan (drop-off mentality)
- 🚫 Treatment inappropriate or kickback involved
- 🚫 Legal/safety issues (coercion, violence risk)
- 🚫 Severe mental health crisis (psych referral needed first)

### **Maintaining Dignity in Mode 3** (Planned Surprise):
- ✅ Tone is love, not attack
- ✅ Acknowledge violation: "We know this feels like an ambush"
- ✅ Explain why: "We tried other approaches, disease progressed"
- ✅ No physical force (consequences are relational, not physical)
- ✅ Long-term relationship focus: "We love you whether you go today or not"

## 🧘 CHEAT SHEET 9: TRAUMA-INFORMED FACILITATION

### **SAMHSA's 6 Principles**:
1. **Safety** — Physical and emotional safety through structure
2. **Trustworthiness** — Be transparent about what will happen
3. **Choice** — Offer options ("Share if you're comfortable")
4. **Collaboration** — Co-create, don't impose
5. **Empowerment** — Emphasize strengths and capacity
6. **Cultural Sensitivity** — Honor diverse backgrounds

### **TiPS Debrief Framework**:
1. **T** — Orientation (set up the debrief)
2. **I** — Review (what happened?)

5. **Recovery** — How will you apply this?

### **Red Flags During Training**:
- 🚨 Participant tearful/distressed → Offer break, private check-in
- 🚨 Suicidal ideation → Immediate private conversation, crisis line
- 🚨 Intoxication → Private conversation, ask to leave if necessary
- 🚨 Harm disclosure → Document, mandatory reporting if required

## 🛠️ CHEAT SHEET 11: FACILITATOR TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Challenges & Responses**:

**Challenge**: Participant dominates discussion

**Challenge**: Participant becomes emotional (tears, distress)
**Response**: Acknowledge, validate, offer break, check in privately after

**Challenge**: Participant disagrees with Core Values approach
**Response**: "That's a valid perspective. What's your experience with [topic]? Let's explore the different viewpoints."

**Challenge**: Simulation goes off track
**Response**: Pause if needed: "Let's pause for a moment. [Name], what's happening for you right now?"

**Challenge**: Running behind schedule
**Response**: Prioritize experiential over didactic, shorten breaks if needed, extend day slightly with participant agreement

**Challenge**: Participant asks question outside your expertise
**Response**: "Great question. I don't have that answer right now. Let's add it to the 'parking lot' and I'll research it for tomorrow."

## 🔄 CHEAT SHEET 12: FACILITATOR MANTRAS

When you feel stuck or uncertain, return to these:

**"Guide, not guru."**
I don't have all the answers. My job is to create space for discovery.

**"Trust the process."**
Discomfort and confusion are part of learning. Stay present.

**"Presence over performance."**
I don't need to be perfect. I need to be real.

**"Connection before content."**
If the group isn't feeling safe, no content will land.

**"Awareness, Coordination, Care."**
The three pillars guide everything I do.

**"Dignity is non-negotiable."**
In every scenario, every mode, every interaction — dignity first.

**"Recovery is a team sport."**
The Pivot Person, the family, the interventionist, the coaches, the therapists — we're all on the same team.

**"When in doubt, ask."**
Better to acknowledge uncertainty than to pretend to know.
