Introduction 
Welcome to Core Values family recovery coaching 
Family recovery is not about fixing the addicted person—it's about healing the entire family system. As a Core Values family recovery coach, you will guide families through a transformative 52-week journey that shifts focus from crisis management to values-based living, from codependency to healthy interdependence, and from chaos to emotional sobriety. 
What is a CORE VALUES family recovery coach
A family recovery coach is a professional who helps families navigate the challenges of having a family with any type of addiction. 
What they do
Educate families about addiction and recovery 
Help families make healthy choices and communication patterns 
Helps connect those seeking recovery to the appropriate resources
Support family members dealing with trauma and codependency 
Prevent enabling behaviors while promoting healing 
Most have training in recovery coaching, intervention, addiction counseling, social work, or psychology with specialized certification in family dynamics and addiction. 
When to seek help: Families typically work with coaches when they feel overwhelmed – when they’re unsure how to help without enabling, dealing with repeated relapses, or wanting to repair damaged relationships. The coach helps the entire family system heal and develop effective strategies to support recovery while protecting their own well-being. 
What family recovery coaching is “Not” 
Clinical therapy or medical treatment 
A cure or guarantee of sobriety 
Crisis intervention or emergency services 
Decision-making for families 
Treatment for the addicted person
A replacement for professional addiction treatment 
A quick fix or miracle solution

Core values family recovery coaching is a XX week coaching program led by a core values family recovery coach
The Core Values family recovery coaching Difference 
Unlike traditional family therapy or Al-Anon groups, Core Values family recovery coaching:
Operates from a coaching model focused on forward movement and goals 
Uses the 52-week structured curriculum as a roadmap 
Integrates seamlessly with individual coaching and intervention services 
Emphasizes values-based decision making over problem-focused discussions
Delivers services remotely for accessibility and consistency 
Focuses on creating a "new normal" rather than returning to pre-addiction dynamics 
Core Values Roles and Boundaries

Core Values Certified Coaches believe that recovery is a team sport. What makes our program different from other programs in the field is our capacity to work together. We know where our work begins and another’s begins. We collaborate seamlessly in service to our clients, and to each other. 

Peer support
Primary Focus: Connection, accountability, and modeling recovery 
Serves: The pivot person in early or ongoing recovery
Definition: A Peer Support is someone with lived experience in recovery who walks alongside others beginning or deepening their own recovery journey. Their power comes from identification, not instruction. They model hope, consistency, and honesty—helping clients stay connected to community, values, and daily recovery actions.
Boundaries: 
Does not provide therapy, diagnose, or prescribe
Does not provide structured coaching
Does not take clients through the 12 steps (but may take them to meetings)
Does not design treatment plans or direct interventions 
Does share personal experience appropriately and use it to build trust
Does help the client experience life in sobriety
Focus: Support, connection
Executive Recovery Coach
Primary Focus: Long-term growth, integration, and optimization, typically collaborates with a family coach 
Serves: The pivot person ready for structured growth
Definition: An Executive Recovery Coach is a trained professional coach who helps clients translate recovery principles into sustainable life practices such as putting plans and actions into effect. They bridge the gap between recovery and leadership—helping clients with executive function skills including planning and organization, time management, emotional regulation and task initiation.  This leads to helping the client clarify values, set goals, develop habits, and embody integrity in every domain of life.
Boundaries: 
Does not provide clinical or diagnostic treatment 
Does not replace sponsorship or therapy 
Does not act as an interventionist if the pivot person relapses
Does collaborate with a family coach
Does hold clients accountable to their own goals, values, and commitments
Does not advocate for the family, but helps the client advocate for themselves
Focus: Growth, structure, performance, and alignment with core values
Interventionist
Primary Focus: Connection, stabilization, and coordination of care 
Serves: The family system seeking to help a loved one enter recovery
Definition: An Interventionist guides families through the process of helping a loved one move from crisis to connection. They translate fear, chaos, and emotion into coordinated action. Their role blends assessment, planning, and compassionate confrontation — helping families make decisions, access resources, and begin the recovery journey together.
Boundaries: 
Does not provide long-term coaching or therapy 
Does not force outcomes through coercion or control 
Does advocates for the individual and the family system 
Focus: Stabilization, coordination, advocacy, and transition into recovery
Family Coach
Primary Focus: Healing, boundaries, and relational recovery 
Serves: The family members and loved ones of someone in recovery
Definition: A Family Coach supports family members as they heal from the impact of addiction and learn to live their own recovery. They help loved ones understand codependency, set boundaries, and reconnect with their own values and well-being. The work often parallels the individual’s recovery but focuses on the family’s side of the street.
Boundaries: 
Does not manage the addicted person’s treatment or recovery plan 
Does not act as the loved one’s therapist or case manager 
Does collaborate with the Executive Coach
Does help family members practice detachment, communication, and self-care 
Focus: Family growth, boundaries, recovery education, and emotional resilience

Ethics and Professional Standards
Why We Lead with Ethics
Ethics are the foundation of Core Values Coaching. You can’t have values without ethics. If we want to help our clients connect with their values, we must lay a solid foundation upon which that connection can rest, and that foundation must be built with ethics. Focusing on ethics from the start shows that we don't just talk about values but live by them. It ensures that how we act as coaches matches the honesty and realness we want to teach our clients. Being ethical in coaching is more than just following rules; it's about living the values we believe in.
Admitting that we can hurt others is a severe but necessary part of ethical coaching. The relationship between a coach and client is naturally unbalanced regarding power and influence, especially in the early phases of recovery, where this program is mainly applied. Ethical coaching protects against this imbalance causing harm, whether through misusing power, crossing boundaries, or misunderstanding roles. It's a promise not to hurt anyone, putting the client's well-being, independence, and growth first.
Our Code of Ethics:
As a Core Values Coach, I Will:
Accurately identify my qualifications, expertise, and certifications to all I serve and the public.
Conduct myself by this Code of Ethics.
Remain free from any substances that affect my ability to perform my duties as a Core Values Coach.
Honor my client’s time by making my work with them about them, not about me.
Recognize personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that may impact my performance as a Core Values Coach.
Maintain connections with other coaches so that I can address personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that negatively affect my recovery.
Respect and acknowledge the professional efforts and contributions of others.
Maintain documentation for all client records.
Protect the privacy and confidentiality of all clients.
I will immediately disclose any perceived conflict of interest to my client and to another coach and make an outbound referral if necessary.
Disclose any pre-existing professional, social, or business relationships that may affect my client. 
Terminate the relationship when it ceases to be helpful to the client.
Refer the client out to a relevant therapist and cease coaching when necessary.
Keep and maintain appropriate, culturally sensitive boundaries with everyone I serve.
Not engage in sexual or personal relationships with any client or client family members.
ETHICS AND FAMILY COACHING
Ethics are the invisible architecture that holds family coaching together. In a setting where emotions run high and vulnerability is at its peak, clear ethical grounding ensures that compassion never drifts into confusion, and care never crosses into control. Family coaching is about trust. When families allow a coach into their private world, they are extending deep permission to see and influence sensitive dynamics. Ethics safeguard that trust by defining how power, empathy, and professionalism must coexist. They remind us that good intentions aren’t enough; integrity must shape every choice we make.
Unlike individual coaching, family coaching involves a network of relationships where influence flows in multiple directions. The coach is often seen as a stabilizing force during turbulent times, and with that perception comes tremendous responsibility. Ethical standards protect everyone in that space: the Pivot Person, the family, and the coach. They keep the focus on the client’s autonomy and the family’s growth, not the coach’s opinions, needs, or sense of importance. By leading with ethics, we ensure that every action aligns with our values of honesty, respect, and shared responsibility.
Ethics also teach coaches to lead by example. When we demonstrate transparency, accountability, and self-awareness, we model the very qualities we hope to awaken in the families we serve. In this way, ethics are a practice of alignment, a daily commitment to walk the talk of recovery and values-based living. Ethical integrity doesn’t just make coaching safer; it makes it transformative.


WORKING WITH THE OUTSIDE: Coaches, Therapists, and Sponsors



Therapists bring a clinical view to healing, dealing with trauma and mental illness with professional knowledge. They often focus on healing past hurts and looking at the client's history to find and fix the causes of current problems. This relationship has professional boundaries, with therapists staying distant to give objective, therapeutic support. Therapy is a space for exploring and healing, where clients are encouraged to lead their recovery journey.
Sponsors guide their sponsees through the 12 steps with care and understanding. They act as mentors, sharing their recovery journeys to light the way for others. Their role is hands-on, giving real-time support and being someone to talk to about day-to-day challenges. The sponsor-client relationship is marked by being available and sharing experiences, creating a special bond based on everyday struggles and successes.
Core Values Coaches support the client's future self, encouraging them to imagine and work towards their best version. This role looks to the future, focusing on creating a vision and setting goals to reach it. Coaches challenge clients to step out of their comfort zones, recognizing and dealing with the voice of addiction that may hold them back. By sharing personal stories when appropriate, coaches give practical insights and accountability, helping clients find and use the support and resources they need to succeed.
We Core Values Coaches must adhere to strict boundaries and “know our lane” when working with clients. We should work to support and encourage our family clients to have good relationships with their loved one, both their sponsors if applicable and therapists if applicable  and we should usually help our clients follow their guidance. Coaches will want to create positive relationships with any other professionals their therapists and work as a team to support their clients' recovery. But before doing so, we must seek permission from our clients to disclose our relationships with their therapist. We do so by getting a formal Release of Information (ROI) signed by our client and their therapist so that everyone knows the disclosure and the confidentiality. The same goes for collaborating with an Executive Coach, we must have the clients permission prior to sharing any information.
The boundary between a coach and a sponsor is essential to keep the coaching relationship strong. While a Core Values Coach may personally take part in 12-step programs, their professional role is separate. Direct involvement in the client's 12-step journey, like going to 12-step meetings together, is kept to a minimum to ensure the coach stays an objective, supportive figure focused on the client's overall recovery journey and to create space for the client to establish connections in the 12-step rooms. Often, when a coach is present, a client may have difficulty finding a sponsor, as it’s assumed that the coach is the sponsor. The coach should always follow the sponsor's lead regarding the client's 12-step work. This separation ensures that the unique benefits of both sponsorship and coaching are kept, giving full support for the person's recovery.
It’s also worth noting that the coach may not disclose their relationship to anyone, even in a 12-step room. While the client may disclose that their coach is their coach, it is inappropriate for the coach to disclose that relationship as it is a breach of confidentiality. It is best to bring clients into meetings to help them walk through the door and then get out of the way so you are not mistaken for a sponsor. 
The boundary between a coach and a therapist is also vital. A therapist generally works from the present and into the past. They help heal past trauma, process emotional reactions, and help pull apart and understand conflict. A core values coach works from the present and into the future. We set goals and create visions for the future. We help challenge assumptions and interpretations of events, but we don’t spend much time trying to fix or heal our clients — we aren't usually the ones who handle that. If we do, we must encourage our client to work with their therapist or make a therapeutic referral. 
Therapists also diagnose people with words like “depression,” “PTSD,” “codependency,” and even “addiction.” Core values coaches tend to shy away from these words, other than helping clients put a name to feelings and encouraging them to seek therapeutic resources to investigate further. Coaches focus on helping clients build a positive future rather than diagnosing issues from the past. We empower clients to create their own solutions, offering guidance and support without trying to "fix" them. If deeper emotional work is needed, we refer to therapists who are trained to handle those situations.
By staying in our lane and respecting professional boundaries, Core Values Coaches create a safe space for growth and self-discovery, complementing the important work of therapists and sponsors.
As Core Values Coaches, we expect the sponsors and therapists working with our clients to be ethical. If we spot unethical behavior, we guide our clients to the appropriate resources to handle the situation. We can often use the moment to teach our clients about values while empowering them to make their own choices. We do not often rescue our clients but provide them with the resources to rescue themselves. When in doubt about what to do, we seek the guidance of other coaches.


LANGUAGE CHOICES
Healthy Choices vs Boundaries
We use the term “Healthy Choices” rather than “boundaries” because it places ownership and empowerment squarely where it belongs—with the individual making the choice. The language of “boundaries” can subtly reinforce the idea that our actions are reactions to someone else’s behavior, especially the Pivot Person’s. “Healthy Choices” reframes that dynamic. It reminds each family member that they are responsible for their own emotional safety, energy, and engagement, regardless of what others do. This shift moves the focus from controlling or protecting against another person to honoring one’s own values and limits. It’s about choosing what aligns with well-being, rather than policing what others can or can’t do. In this way, “Healthy Choices” becomes a language of agency, self-respect, and calm strength—an empowering practice that models the same self-leadership we hope the Pivot Person will develop in their own recovery.
Pivot Person vs. Person of Concern
We intentionally use the term “Pivot Person” instead of “Person of Concern” because language shapes relationship—and relationship shapes recovery. “Person of Concern” subtly reinforces a one-directional focus: concern about someone, often placing them at the center of the problem. That framing can unintentionally isolate or objectify the individual, suggesting that the family’s work revolves around them.
“Pivot Person,” by contrast, invites shared responsibility and movement. It acknowledges that this person’s struggle has created a natural pivot point for the whole family system to turn toward growth and recovery. The word “pivot” implies action, agency, and interconnection—something we do together, not something we fix in someone else.
In this framing, the Pivot Person becomes a peer in the family’s recovery process, not a patient or project. Their willingness to change is deeply valuable, but it’s matched by the family’s willingness to look at their own adaptations, coping styles, and opportunities for healing. The family pivots with them. This shift transforms blame into collaboration and concern into collective transformation—because sustainable recovery happens when everyone learns to move together.



Essential Skills for family recovery coaching 
The 80% Rule: Core Coaching Competencies 
The following skills represent 80% of effective family recovery coaching. Master these fundamentals before advancing to specialized techniques. 
1. Acknowledging and Validating 
Acknowledging and validating is the foundational practice of recognizing and affirming a client's experiences, emotions, and perspectives without judgment or the need to fix or change them. This competency involves actively listening to what the client shares and reflecting back that their feelings, thoughts, and experiences are real, understandable, and worthy of attention. When a coach acknowledges and validates effectively, they create a safe container for honest exploration and growth. 
This doesn't mean agreeing with every choice or perspective a client presents; rather, it means honoring their internal experience as legitimate and meaningful. Validation helps clients feel seen and heard, which reduces defensiveness and opens pathways for deeper self-reflection. In family systems affected by addiction or crisis, this competency is particularly crucial, as individuals often feel dismissed, blamed, or invisible within their family dynamics. By providing authentic acknowledgment, coaches help clients reconnect with their own wisdom and inner resources.
In Practice: 
"I can see how exhausting it's been to live with this uncertainty" 
"Your anger makes complete sense given what you've been through" 
"It takes courage to admit that the old ways aren't working" 
Key Points: 
Validation doesn't mean agreement with behavior 
Acknowledge effort and progress, not just outcomes 
Mirror emotional tone to show attunement 
Avoid rushing to solutions before feelings are heard 
2. Asking Empowering Open-Ended Questions 
The art of asking empowering, open-ended questions is one of the most powerful tools in a coach's repertoire. Unlike closed questions that elicit simple yes or no answers, open-ended questions invite exploration, reflection, and discovery. Empowering questions are specifically crafted to shift clients from problem-focused thinking to possibility-focused thinking, from external blame to internal agency, and from confusion to clarity. 
These questions typically begin with "what," "how," or "who" rather than "why," which can trigger defensiveness or intellectualization. The most effective empowering questions challenge assumptions, expand perspectives, and invite clients to access their own wisdom rather than looking to the coach for answers. Questions like "What would be possible if you believed you deserved support?" or "How might you respond differently if you trusted your own judgment?" move clients toward self-authorship of their lives. This competency requires coaches to remain genuinely curious, to trust the client's capacity for insight, and to resist the temptation to ask leading questions that reflect the coach's agenda rather than the client's discovery process.
In Practice: 
"What would detachment with love look like for you?" 
"How do you know when you're operating from values versus fear?" 
"What boundaries would need to be in place to healthy choices would help you feel safer feel safer in this relationship?" 
"Where do you notice yourself trying to control outcomes?" 
Avoid: 
Leading questions ("Don't you think you should set a health choice?") 
Yes/no questions ("Are you ready to let go?") 
Multiple questions stacked together
Questions that contain hidden advice 

3. Obtaining Buy-In 
Obtaining buy-in is the collaborative process of ensuring that clients are genuinely invested in and committed to the coaching relationship, the goals they set, and the actions they choose to take. This competency goes far beyond simple agreement; it involves creating authentic alignment between what the client says they want and what they're truly willing to do. Effective coaches recognize that lasting change cannot be imposed or persuaded into being—it must emerge from the client's own motivation and readiness.
Obtaining buy-in requires coaches to slow down, check assumptions, and explicitly invite clients to assess their own commitment levels. This might sound like, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how committed do you feel to this action step?" or "What would make this goal feel truly meaningful to you?" When clients haven't genuinely bought in, they may sabotage their own progress, disappear from coaching, or go through the motions without real engagement. By prioritizing authentic buy-in over surface-level compliance, coaches honor client autonomy and create the conditions for sustainable transformation. This is especially important when working with family systems, where individuals may feel pressure to change to please others rather than from their own internal conviction.
In Practice: 
"What resonates with you about this approach?" 
"How does this week's focus align with what you're experiencing?" 
"Would it be helpful to explore this further?" 
"What feels most important to work on right now?" 
Signs of Strong Buy-In: 
Family members actively participate in homework 
They bring up concepts from previous sessions 
They ask questions and seek clarification 
They express ownership of their recovery process 

4. Strategic Self-Disclosure
Strategic self-disclosure is the intentional and boundaried sharing of the coach's own experiences, feelings, or observations in service of the client's growth and learning. Unlike casual conversation or friendship, where self-disclosure may be mutual and unfiltered, coaching self-disclosure is always purposeful, brief, and client-centered. When used skillfully, strategic self-disclosure can normalize difficult experiences, model vulnerability, challenge isolation, or provide a relational mirror that helps clients see themselves more clearly. A coach might share a brief personal example to illustrate that they understand a particular struggle, or might disclose an observation about how they're feeling in the moment with the client to provide valuable feedback about interpersonal dynamics. 
This competency requires significant discernment and restraint. The coach must always ask: "Is this disclosure in service of my client's needs, or my own?" Effective self-disclosure is brief, relevant, and followed by redirecting attention back to the client. It should never burden the client with the coach's unresolved issues, create role confusion, or shift the focus of the coaching relationship. When used strategically, self-disclosure deepens trust, strengthens the coaching alliance, and demonstrates the kind of authentic, boundaried relating that clients can model in their own lives.
When to Share Personal Experience: 
To normalize difficult emotions or experiences 
To model vulnerability and growth 
To provide hope during discouraging moments 
To illustrate a concept or principle 
How to Share Effectively: 
Ask permission first: "Would a brief example from my experience be helpful?" 2. Keep it concise: Under 90 seconds 
Make it relevant: Directly connected to their current situation 
Return focus to them: "What resonates with you about that?" 
Risks to Avoid: 
Making sessions about your story 
Blurring professional boundaries
Competing with their experience 
Providing unsolicited advice through stories 



The Three STAGES OF FAMILY RECOVERY
Understanding the Journey: A Three-Stage Framework for Family Recovery
Recovery unfolds in phases, each with its own signals of recovery and relapse, challenges, and breakthroughs. For families navigating the complex terrain of addiction recovery, one of the most disorienting aspects can be not knowing where they are in the process or what to expect next. The Three Stages of Family Recovery — Landing, Stabilization, and Optimization — provide a compassionate roadmap that helps families make sense of their experience. This framework isn't about imposing rigid timelines or measuring success; it's about creating a shared language that transforms confusion into a clear plan. When we can name what's happening, we reduce shame, normalize challenges, and illuminate the path forward. As coaches, our role is to gently reflect back what we see, helping families recognize where they are without judgment and offering hope for what's possible when they engage in the recovery process. This developmental lens allows us to meet families exactly where they are—honoring their unique pace while holding steady confidence in their capacity to heal and grow together.
Recovery is not a single event—it’s a progression of awareness, stabilization, and growth that unfolds over time. By breaking the process into three distinct phases—Landing, Stabilization, and Optimization—we give both the Pivot Person and their family a clear map of where they are and what comes next. This structure helps families move from confusion and crisis toward clarity and confidence, step by step.
Our coaching methodology is built around awareness and reflection. Families often enter the recovery process reacting to crises, not recognizing the patterns that have shaped their responses. By naming each phase and describing what’s happening within it, we create language that transforms chaos into understanding. When a coach can gently mirror back, “This is the phase your family is in,” it brings relief, validation, and a sense of direction.
The three-phase model isn’t meant to label or grade a family—it’s meant to show them where they are at so they can move forward with awareness. When we reference these stages in conversation, we’re not diagnosing; we’re simply holding up a mirror to the system so the family can see itself more clearly.
In practice, this might sound like:
“What you’re describing sounds a lot like the Landing phase—everything feels uncertain and urgent right now. That’s a normal beginning place.”
or
“It seems your family is entering Stabilization—you’re building consistency, and trust is starting to return.”
These reflections give families orientation. They transform shame into understanding and overwhelm into a sense of pathway.  Our role is to shepherd, not steer. We create a safe space where the family can recognize patterns, celebrate progress, and prepare for the next stage. We use gentle curiosity and language that centers partnership—reminding them that recovery is something they walk through together, not something they do to the Pivot Person.
STAGE 1: Acceptance/Landing
In the Acceptance/Landing phase, the Pivot Person is coming to terms with the reality of their condition and beginning to accept help. It’s an emotionally charged period marked by denial, fear, and surrender. The family often experiences equal turbulence—relief that change is beginning mixed with anxiety about what it means. This is when emotional containment and clear boundaries are most needed from the family system.

How the program works
Our job as coaches is to shepherd and guide our families through the three stages of recovery alongside our collaborators. The Core Values Family coaching program is designed to last for one year, with most of the intensive work happening in the first ten weeks. The family begins to get answers to their concerns and behaviors begin to change. The family is able to find a safe place  to move forward. This is a parallel process .This means the  “pivot person” and family are working to better understand their recovery. Each module can be used independently , but the modules are designed to flow together.  Some families may need more time with an individual module . A coach may discover that an individual family member may need more support in understanding a module.  Supporting this family member may take some individual sessions. The coach continues to move forward while supporting the individual as well as the rest of the family. The coach will learn with each session the support needed to create a supportive forward moving plan.  The first session is to identify the needs and concerns of the family. Validate the family and begin to share how the process works.
The coach prioritizes each of the 10 modules ;
1.The First session.
2.Circle of Control
3. Why addiction feels personal
4.Secrets in Addiction
5. Expectations our Demise
6. Blocks
7. Core Values
8. Power of the Pause
9.Responding vs Reacting
10. Love vs Enabling
11. Grief That Does Not Have a Funeral/ Detach with Love
12.  Discussing what the family has learned about themselves. Discover and discuss applications that need  more support.

THe system is designed to take the family through a journey of learning new skills , introspection, and forward thinking . The curriculum is designed to create positive change in the family system. Some sessions may take longer for family members to grasp . Stay with them !!!! As the coach continues to support the family, they will be able to identify changes and thought patterns that will improve their recovery. The coach is able to allow the family to direct sessions and find their answers.
Here is a check list for the family coach to guide you through necessary components for the family's recovery.
