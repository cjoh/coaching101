## PART 1: THE TWO-PHASE CONTACT MODEL (10 minutes)

### 2:00-2:10 — INTRODUCTION: WHY TWO PHASES?

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Welcome back from lunch. We've just spent the morning learning about the 5-mode Intervention Continuum—the framework for HOW we intervene once we're engaged with a family.

But before we get to intervention, there's a critical professional question we need to address: **When a family calls you, how do you determine if intervention is even the right approach? And how do you do that ethically, without pressuring them into something they don't need?**

This is where many interventionists go wrong. They either:
1. **Give away too much for free**—spending hours assessing families without compensation, then feeling resentful or burned out, OR
2. **Sell intervention to everyone**—seeing every call as a potential client, regardless of whether intervention is truly appropriate

Both paths are unethical and unsustainable.

Today, I'm going to teach you a two-phase model that protects both you AND the family."

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"**Phase 1: Initial Inquiry Call** is your mutual exploration. The family is asking, 'Can you help us?' and you're asking, 'Is intervention appropriate here, and am I the right person?' This is FREE. It's a consultation, not a commitment.

**Phase 2: Formal Assessment** is when you've both decided there's a potential fit, and now you need to do the deep work of understanding the family's situation, dynamics, readiness, and needs. This is PAID PROFESSIONAL WORK.

Here's the key ethical principle: **You charge for the assessment SO THAT you remain objective about whether they need an intervention.**

If your income depends on them saying yes to intervention, you have a conflict of interest. If they've already paid you for an honest assessment, you're free to tell them the truth—even if the truth is, 'You don't need me.'"

---

### **Why This Matters: The Ethics of Assessment**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let me tell you what happens when interventionists DON'T charge for assessment:

**Scenario A: The Free Assessment Trap**
- Family calls, you spend 2 hours on the phone gathering information.
- You meet with them for another 2 hours.
- You've invested 4 hours of unpaid work.
- Now they say, 'We need to think about it' or 'That's too expensive.'
- You feel resentful. You gave away your expertise for free.
- Worse: You may have unconsciously pressured them because you NEED them to say yes to recoup your time.

**Scenario B: The Sales Pressure Trap**
- You only make money if they hire you to do an intervention.
- Every family that calls becomes a sales opportunity.
- You unconsciously—or consciously—steer them toward intervention even when it might not be appropriate.
- You recommend Mode 3 (Planned Surprise) because it's more lucrative, when Mode 1 (Collaborative) would have worked.
- You've become a salesperson, not an interventionist.

**The Ethical Solution:**
- Charge for assessment.
- Make your money on the ASSESSMENT, not the intervention.
- This frees you to tell the family the truth: 'Based on what I'm seeing, you don't need intervention yet. Here's what I recommend instead.'
- If they DO need intervention, they've already invested in the process and you've done the necessary due diligence."

**[PAUSE - Let this land]**

"This is one of the most important professional boundaries you'll establish. It protects you from burnout, and it protects families from being sold services they don't need."

---

## PART 2: THE INITIAL INQUIRY CALL (15 minutes)

### 2:10-2:25 — THE FREE CONSULTATION: STRUCTURE & PURPOSE

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Okay, so someone calls you. They found you through a referral, your website, Google. They say, 'My daughter is addicted to opioids, and I don't know what to do.'

What do you say? What do you ask? And how do you know if this conversation should lead to a formal assessment?"

---

### **Purpose of the Inquiry Call**

**[FLIP CHART - Write as you teach]**

**Three Questions the Inquiry Call Answers:**

1. **Is there a substance use or behavioral problem that might warrant intervention?**
   - Not your job to diagnose, but you need to know there's a legitimate concern
   - Red flag: "My wife thinks I drink too much, but I don't" (Pivot Person calling, precontemplation—probably not ready for family intervention)

2. **Is this family a good fit for MY services?**
   - Do I have the skills/experience for this situation?
   - Are there red flags that make me uncomfortable? (Safety, ethics, complexity beyond my scope)
   - Is this family coachable? (Some families are so chaotic or hostile that intervention won't work)

3. **Is intervention the right approach, or should I refer them elsewhere?**
   - Maybe they need family therapy first
   - Maybe Pivot Person is already in treatment and family needs coaching, not intervention
   - Maybe this is a crisis requiring emergency services (ER, 988)

---

### **The Inquiry Call Script**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Read or paraphrase]**

"Here's a sample structure for the inquiry call. Adapt it to your style, but notice the flow."

---

**INQUIRY CALL STRUCTURE (15-30 minutes)**

**1. Opening & Context (2 minutes)**
- "Thank you for reaching out. I'm [name], and I specialize in family interventions for substance use and behavioral health challenges. Before we dive in, I want to let you know that this initial call is a free consultation. We'll explore your situation together, and by the end, we'll both have a sense of whether I might be able to help. Does that sound okay?"

**2. The Presenting Problem (5 minutes)**
- "Tell me what's happening. What's bringing you to call today?"
- **Listen for**:
  - Who is the Pivot Person? (age, relationship to caller, living situation)
  - What substance(s) or behavior?
  - How long has this been going on?
  - What consequences have occurred? (health, legal, relational, job)
  - What's the **urgency**? (Is there a crisis happening right now?)

**3. Previous Attempts to Help (3 minutes)**
- "What have you or the family tried so far?"
- **Listen for**:
  - Previous treatment attempts (completed, left AMA, refused)
  - Informal family conversations (did they go well or blow up?)
  - Therapy, 12-step, outpatient
  - This tells you their **readiness level** and whether they're at a point where formal intervention makes sense

**4. Family System Quick Scan (5 minutes)**
- "Who else is affected by this? Who's in the Pivot Person's life?"
- **Listen for**:
  - Family structure (partner, kids, parents, siblings)
  - Who's supportive vs. who's enabling vs. who's estranged
  - Any violence, abuse, safety concerns
  - This gives you a sense of **relational capacity**

**5. Assess Urgency & Safety (3 minutes)**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent does this feel to you?"
- "Are there any immediate safety concerns—suicidal thoughts, overdose risk, violence?"
- **This is your Safety/Urgency score** (from Mode Selector)

**6. Mutual Decision Point (5 minutes)**
- "Based on what you've shared, here's what I'm hearing: [brief reflection]. It sounds like intervention MIGHT be appropriate here, but I'd need to do a full assessment to understand your family's specific situation and recommend the best approach."
- **Transition to Assessment**:
  - "If you'd like to move forward, the next step is a formal assessment. This is a 60-90 minute conversation where I'll gather detailed information about your family, assess readiness, and make a recommendation about whether intervention is appropriate and, if so, which mode would be the best fit."
  - "The assessment fee is $[amount]. If we determine that intervention isn't the right path, I'll refer you to other resources. If it IS the right path, we'll create a plan together. Does that make sense?"

**Outcomes:**
- **YES → Schedule formal assessment** (they agree to paid next step)
- **NO → Provide resources and leave door open** ("I understand. Here are some resources that might help. If things change, feel free to reach out.")
- **NOT YET → They need time to think** ("Take your time. Call me when you're ready.")

---

**[DEBRIEF - 3 minutes]**

"What do you notice about this structure?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- It's **exploratory, not prescriptive**—you're not telling them what to do yet
- You're **transparent about the process**—they know this is free, assessment is paid
- You're **assessing fit mutually**—they're deciding if you're right for them, you're deciding if they're right for you
- You're **protecting yourself from scope creep**—the call has a clear boundary (15-30 min)
- You're **setting up the ethical framework**—assessment is where the real work begins

---

## PART 3: THE FORMAL ASSESSMENT (20 minutes)

### 2:25-2:45 — THE PAID ASSESSMENT: STRUCTURE & ETHICS

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Transition]**

"Okay, they've agreed to a formal assessment. They've paid your fee. Now what?

Now you do the deep work of understanding this family so thoroughly that you can make an informed, ethical recommendation."

---

### **Why You Charge: The Ethical Case**

**[FLIP CHART - Write as you teach]**

**Four Reasons Charging for Assessment is Ethical (and Essential):**

**1. OBJECTIVITY**
- Once they've paid you for assessment, your income is NOT dependent on them saying yes to intervention
- You can recommend "Don't hire me" without financial loss
- This removes the conflict of interest that plagues commission-based models

**2. PROFESSIONALISM**
- Assessment is skilled clinical work (family systems assessment, stage of change evaluation, mode selection)
- You've trained for this. Your expertise has value.
- Charging signals that this is professional work, not informal advice

**3. MUTUAL COMMITMENT**
- When someone pays for assessment, they show up prepared and engaged
- They take your recommendations seriously
- It filters out people who are "just shopping" or not truly ready to engage

**4. THOROUGHNESS**
- Paid assessments mean you can take the time needed (60-90 min) to do it right
- You're not rushing to "close the sale"
- You can afford to be thorough because your time is compensated

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Emphasis]**

"Here's the key: **You charge for the assessment so that you DON'T have to sell them an intervention they don't need.**

If your assessment reveals that:
- They're not ready for intervention yet → You tell them and refer them to family coaching or therapy
- The Pivot Person is already in treatment → You offer family support, not intervention
- The situation is too high-risk for you → You refer to someone with more experience
- They need crisis services, not planned intervention → You help them access 988, ER, etc.

And you do all of this WITHOUT worrying about losing income, because you've already been paid for your professional assessment."

---

### **What to Gather During the Formal Assessment**

**[FLIP CHART - Refer back to Mode Selector Tool]**

"Remember the Mode Selector Tool we learned this morning? The formal assessment is where you gather ALL the information needed to score that tool accurately."

**[STRUCTURED ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK]**

**ASSESSMENT STRUCTURE (60-90 minutes)**

**I. Opening & Contracting (5 minutes)**
- "Thank you for making this time. Today, we're going to dive deep into your family's situation so I can understand what you're dealing with and recommend the best path forward. At the end, I'll share my assessment and recommendations. If intervention is appropriate, I'll explain which mode I think fits your family and why. If I think you need something else—therapy, family coaching, crisis services—I'll tell you that too. My job is to give you an honest, professional assessment, not to sell you something. Sound good?"

---

**II. Detailed Family & Substance Use History (20 minutes)**

**PIVOT PERSON PROFILE:**
- Name, age, gender, living situation
- Substance(s) of choice (primary, secondary)
- Duration of use (when did it start, when did it become problematic)
- Pattern of use (daily, binge, functional, chaotic)
- Previous treatment (when, where, how long, outcome)
- Previous attempts at quitting (success, failure, relapse patterns)
- Co-occurring mental health (depression, anxiety, trauma, ADHD)
- Medical complications (liver damage, overdoses, ER visits, hospitalizations)
- Legal issues (DUI, possession, probation, incarceration)
- Employment status (working, fired, on leave, disability)

**CONSEQUENCES INVENTORY:**
- Health consequences (weight, sleep, chronic conditions)
- Relational consequences (divorce, estrangement, conflict)
- Financial consequences (debt, job loss, unpaid bills)
- Legal consequences (arrests, court dates, CPS involvement)
- Spiritual/values consequences ("This isn't who they are")

---

**III. Family System Mapping (15 minutes)**

**Who's in the network?**
- Concerned Persons (who cares and is available to participate)
- Enablers (who's helping the disease progress, often unconsciously)
- Estranged members (who's cut off, and why)
- Allies (therapist, pastor, employer, friends in recovery)

**Relational dynamics:**
- Who has the strongest relationship with Pivot Person?
- Are there triangles? (e.g., Mom and Dad disagree about how to handle daughter)
- Any abuse, violence, safety concerns in family history?
- How does the family communicate? (openly, through conflict, shutdown)
- Have they tried talking about this before? What happened?

---

**IV. Readiness & Stage of Change Assessment (10 minutes)**

**Pivot Person's awareness:**
- Precontemplation: "I don't have a problem"
- Contemplation: "Maybe I have a problem"
- Preparation: "I need to do something"

**Family's awareness:**
- Do they understand addiction as a disease?
- Are they enabling? (paying bills, covering up, rescuing from consequences)
- Are they ready to change THEIR behavior?

---

**V. Safety & Urgency Evaluation (10 minutes)**

**Immediate risks (Score 0-10):**
- Suicidal ideation or plan
- Overdose risk (pattern of overdoses, using alone, fentanyl exposure)
- Medical crisis (withdrawal risk, organ damage)
- Violence (toward self or others)
- Children at risk (neglect, exposure to using, CPS involvement)
- Legal crisis (court date, jail time imminent)

---

**VI. Mode Selector Application (10 minutes)**

**You now have all three scores:**
- **Safety/Urgency**: ___ / 10
- **Readiness Level**: Precontemplation / Contemplation / Preparation
- **Relational Capacity**: ___ / 10

**Use the Mode Selector Algorithm** (from Session 2.3) to determine recommended intervention mode.

---

**VII. Assessment Summary & Recommendation (15 minutes)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Sample]**

"Okay, based on everything you've shared, here's what I'm seeing:

[Briefly summarize key points]
- Your [relationship] is in [stage of addiction], using [substance] for [duration]
- The consequences include [health, relational, legal, financial]
- Your family has tried [previous attempts], and here's what happened
- The urgency level is [low/moderate/high/crisis] because [specific reasons]
- Your [relationship] is in [Precontemplation/Contemplation/Preparation], meaning [explain stage]
- Your family's communication and relationships are [relational capacity score], which tells me [explain]

**Based on this assessment, here's my recommendation:**

**Option A: Intervention IS Appropriate**
- 'I believe intervention could be helpful for your family. Based on the Mode Selector, I recommend [Mode X: Name]. Here's what that would look like: [brief description].'
- 'The timeline would be [X weeks], the process would involve [who participates], and the goal would be [treatment entry, family healing, etc.].'
- 'If you'd like to move forward, here's what the next steps would be: [process overview].'
- 'Do you have questions? What feels right or hard about this recommendation?'

**Option B: Intervention is NOT Appropriate Yet**
- 'Based on what I'm hearing, I don't think formal intervention is the right move right now. Here's why: [specific reasons].'
- 'What I think would be more helpful is [family coaching, individual therapy for Pivot Person, crisis services, Al-Anon for family].'
- 'Here are the resources I recommend: [provide referrals].'
- 'If things change and you find yourself needing intervention later, I'm here. But right now, this is what I think will serve your family best.'

**Option C: Referral to Different Interventionist**
- 'Your situation is beyond my scope of practice because [safety concerns, complexity, legal issues, etc.].'
- 'I'm going to refer you to [colleague name], who specializes in [specific issue].'

---

**[PAUSE]**

"Notice what just happened: You did NOT pressure them. You gave them an honest, professional assessment. If intervention isn't appropriate, you told them—even though it means you don't get hired.

THAT is ethical intervention work."

---

## PART 4: PRACTICE EXERCISE (15 minutes)

### 2:45-3:00 — ROLE-PLAY: INQUIRY TO ASSESSMENT TRANSITION

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Setup]**

"We're going to practice the transition from inquiry call to formal assessment. This is where many interventionists struggle—they either give away too much for free, or they pressure too hard.

You're going to practice finding the middle path."

---

**[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS]**

**SETUP (2 minutes):**
- Find a partner
- Decide who's Person A (interventionist) and Person B (concerned family member)

**SCENARIO:**

Person B (family member) says:
*"My son is 32 and has been using heroin for about 5 years. He's been to treatment twice and left both times after a few weeks. We don't know what to do anymore. Can you help us?"*

**Person A (interventionist), your job:**
1. Ask 3-5 clarifying questions to understand the situation (urgency, readiness, relational capacity)
2. After 5 minutes, transition to: "Based on what you've shared, I think a formal assessment would help us determine if intervention is appropriate. Can I tell you about that process?"
3. Explain the assessment (what it is, why it's paid, what they'll get from it)
4. Invite them to decide: "Does that sound like the next step for you?"

**Person B (family member), your job:**
- Respond authentically (you're scared, desperate, hopeful, uncertain)
- Ask questions: "How much does assessment cost?" "What if you say we don't need you?" "How long does this take?"
- At the end, decide: Will you say yes to the assessment, or do you need time to think?

---

**[PRACTICE TIME: 8 minutes]**

**Round 1:** 4 minutes (A interviews B)
**Switch Roles:** 4 minutes (B interviews A)

---

**[DEBRIEF: 5 minutes]**

"Come back together. Let's debrief:
1. **What was challenging about transitioning to the paid assessment?**
2. **What language worked well?**
3. **How did it feel to explain why you charge for assessment?**
4. **Did anyone struggle with the sales-y feeling? How did you navigate that?**"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Listen for discomfort around money/charging
- Normalize the awkwardness—it gets easier with practice
- Emphasize: Charging isn't selfish, it's protective (for you AND them)
- Affirm language that felt authentic and boundaried

---

## SESSION WRAP-UP & TRANSITION (2 minutes)

### 2:58-3:00 — CLOSING & NEXT STEPS

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing]**

"Here's what I want you to remember from this session:

**The inquiry call and the formal assessment are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.**
- Inquiry call = free, exploratory, mutual fit assessment
- Formal assessment = paid, deep dive, professional recommendation

**You charge for assessment SO THAT you can remain objective about whether they need your help.**
- If they don't need intervention, you can say so without financial loss
- This protects them from being sold something they don't need
- This protects you from burnout and resentment

**Your job is to gather the right information and make an informed, ethical recommendation—NOT to sell intervention to everyone who calls.**

Next, we're moving into Core Intervention Tools—Impact Letters, scripts, and logistics planning. But now you have the foundation: You know how to assess whether intervention is even the right path."

---

**[BREAK TRANSITION]**

"We'll take a 15-minute break. When we come back at 3:15, we'll dive into Impact Letters. See you in 15."

---

## FACILITATOR NOTES & TEACHING TIPS

### Key Teaching Points to Emphasize:

1. **The ethical trap of "free work"**
   - Many interventionists burn out because they give away hours of assessment for free
   - Then they feel resentful when families don't hire them
   - Charging for assessment solves this

2. **Charging = objectivity**
   - Once you've been paid for the assessment, you're free to recommend "Don't hire me"
   - This is the OPPOSITE of a sales model
   - It aligns your incentives with the family's best interest

3. **Not everyone needs intervention**
   - Some families need family coaching, not intervention
   - Some Pivot Persons are already in treatment
   - Some situations are too high-risk or complex
   - Your job is to discern, not to sell

4. **Assessment is skilled work**
   - You've trained for this (family systems, stages of change, mode selection)
   - Your expertise has value
   - Professional work deserves professional compensation

5. **The transition from inquiry to assessment is a skill**
   - It feels awkward at first
   - Practice the language
   - Be transparent, not salesy

---

### Common Participant Questions & How to Respond:

**Q: "What if I feel uncomfortable charging?"**
A: "That's normal. But ask yourself: Why? Is it because you don't believe your work has value? Or because you've been socialized to give away your expertise for free (especially if you're a woman)? Charging isn't selfish—it's the only way to remain objective about what families truly need."

**Q: "What if they can't afford the assessment fee?"**
A: "Have a sliding scale if your business model allows, or offer a limited number of pro bono slots. But don't default to free—that sets up the wrong dynamic. You can also help them find funding (insurance, EAP, family pooling resources)."

**Q: "What if they say yes to assessment, I recommend intervention, and then they don't hire me?"**
A: "That's okay. You've been paid for the assessment. They got value (your professional recommendation). Whether they act on it is up to them. Sometimes people need time. Sometimes they go with a different interventionist. That's fine."

**Q: "How much should I charge for assessment?"**
A: "Market rate varies by region and experience, but typically $150-$500 for a 60-90 minute assessment. Research your local market. Your assessment fee should reflect the skilled work you're doing."

### HANDOUT 3: Ethics of Assessment - Why We Charge

```
WHY CHARGING FOR ASSESSMENT IS ETHICAL

1. OBJECTIVITY
   Once paid, your income isn't dependent on them hiring you
   → You can say "You don't need me" without financial loss
   → Removes conflict of interest

2. PROFESSIONALISM
   Assessment is skilled clinical work (family systems, stage of change)
   → Your expertise has value
   → Charging signals professional boundaries

3. MUTUAL COMMITMENT
   Payment = skin in the game
   → Filters out "shoppers" vs. serious inquiries
   → Family takes recommendations seriously

4. THOROUGHNESS
   Paid assessment = adequate time (60-90 min)
   → Not rushing to "close the sale"
   → Can afford to be thorough

THE BOTTOM LINE:
You charge for assessment SO THAT you DON'T have to sell
interventions to people who don't need them.
