## 1. OVERVIEW & PHILOSOPHY

The **Core Values Interventionist Training** is an advanced professional module within the Core Values Recovery system. It prepares participants to guide families, networks, and individuals through the process of moving from crisis to connection.  
This training blends the science of intervention with the heart of coaching—anchoring every practice in dignity, respect, and shared recovery.  

### Guiding Definition  
An **intervention** is a guided process of connection – bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move away from crisis and toward recovery. It is an adaptable process of awareness, coordination, and care that creates the conditions where recovery can begin and stay. The outcome of intervention is *connection, honesty, and hope.*

### Recovery Philosophy  
Recovery is a lifelong process of reclaiming connection to values, meaning, and purpose—often from a loss caused by addiction. It is not a one-time event but an ongoing relationship with growth and awareness.

### What Makes Core Values Different  
- Intervention is part of recovery, and recovery is lifelong.  
- There is no formula; every family and individual requires a personalized path.  
- We choose *invitation over coercion*, *collaboration over control*.  
- Recovery succeeds when the system works together:  
  - Certified interventionist  
  - Intensive treatment (minimum 90 days)  
  - Peer-based recovery meetings  
  - Sober living / IOP / PHP  
  - Licensed therapy  
  - Certified peer and family support  
  - Accountability and monitoring  

Interventionists assess what each family needs and recommend the right mix—without financial interest in any outcome.  
They model ethical collaboration: each professional knows where their work ends and another’s begins.  
Recovery is a team sport, and the whole family participates in the game.

## 2. LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

1. Define and describe the Core Values model of intervention.  
2. Identify the distinctions and overlaps between **Interventionists, Coaches, Therapists, Sponsors, and Peer Professionals.**  
3. Apply systems theory to intervention—recognizing that recovery belongs to the entire family system.  
4. Demonstrate ethical alignment with the Core Values Code of Ethics.  
5. Develop a coordinated intervention plan that honors dignity, invitation, and connection.  
6. Facilitate family communication grounded in awareness, humility, and service.  
7. Collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams using shared language and boundaries.  
8. Integrate Core Values language choices (“Healthy Choices,” “Pivot Person”) in written and verbal communication.  
9. Lead a structured family case study and reflect on lessons learned.  
10. Prepare for the 40-week mentorship phase with clarity on professional expectations and supervision ethics.
