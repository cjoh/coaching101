# DAY 1: AWARENESS SCRIPTS

## DAY 1, SESSION 1.1: WELCOME & ORIENTATION

### **SCRIPT 1.1.A: Land Acknowledgment & Opening**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Good morning, and welcome. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that we gather on the traditional and ancestral lands of [Indigenous nation/people]. We honor their past, present, and future generations who have been stewards of this land since time immemorial. As we begin this training, we commit to approaching this work with the same respect, humility, and care that Indigenous communities have long practiced in their healing traditions."

**[PAUSE - 5 seconds of silence]**

"Thank you for being here."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.1.B: Welcome & Purpose**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"My name is [Your Name], and I'm honored to be your guide for the next three days. Over the course of this training, we're going to explore one of the most challenging, sacred, and hope-filled aspects of addiction recovery work: **intervention**.

You're here because someone you love is struggling‚Äîor because you want to help families who are. You're here because you believe that recovery is possible. You're here because you're willing to learn a different way of showing up for people in crisis.

I want to name something right from the start: **This work is hard.** It will ask you to confront your own fears, your own biases, and your own limits. It will stretch you. And it will also fill you with hope, because you're going to learn that there *is* a way to help‚Äîeven when families feel utterly lost.

Over the next three days, we'll build three things together: **Awareness, Coordination, and Care**.
- Day 1 is about *awareness*‚Äîunderstanding what intervention is, how addiction works, and the language we use.
- Day 2 is about *coordination*‚Äîthe practical 'how-to' of designing and facilitating interventions.
- Day 3 is about *care*‚Äîpracticing these skills and grounding them in ethics and compassion.

By the time you leave here on Day 3, you'll have a framework, tools, and the confidence to guide families through one of the hardest conversations they'll ever have. You ready?"

**[PAUSE for response]**

"Good. Let's begin."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.1.C: Community Agreements Invitation**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Before we dive in, let's establish some community agreements‚Äîways we want to show up together for the next three days. I'll suggest a few, and I invite you to add your own.

**Suggested Agreements:**
1. **Confidentiality** ‚Äî What's shared here stays here. We'll be talking about real families, real pain. Protect each other's stories.
2. **Respect** ‚Äî Honor each person's experience and perspective, even if it's different from yours.
3. **Presence** ‚Äî Be here fully. Phones on silent. If you need to step out, do so quietly.
4. **Curiosity Over Judgment** ‚Äî Approach this work with a learner's mindset. There's no such thing as a stupid question.
5. **Self-Care** ‚Äî If something feels triggering or too much, take care of yourself. Step out, ask for support, or let me know.

What else? What do you need from this group to feel safe and engaged?"

**[INVITE PARTICIPANTS TO ADD AGREEMENTS - Write on flip chart]**

### **SCRIPT 1.1.D: Training Roadmap Overview**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Orientation]**

"Here's how the next three days will unfold:

**Day 1: AWARENESS** ‚Äî We're laying the foundation. You'll learn what intervention is (and isn't), how addiction operates as a systemic issue, and the language we use to create dignity and connection.

**Day 2: COORDINATION** ‚Äî We get practical. You'll learn a framework called the Intervention Continuum‚Äîfive different modes of intervention to match different family situations. You'll practice using assessment tools, writing Impact Letters, and planning interventions.

**Day 3: CARE** ‚Äî You'll practice. We'll run full intervention simulations, debrief with a trauma-informed lens, and close with a deep dive into ethics. You'll leave with a certificate and a clear path forward through our mentorship program.

This training is intense. It's fast-paced. It's emotionally engaging. And it's worth it. Trust the process, trust each other, and trust that you have what it takes to do this work."

## DAY 1, SESSION 1.2: WHAT IS INTERVENTION

### **SCRIPT 1.2.A: Defining Intervention (Core Values Model)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's start with a fundamental question: **What is intervention?**

If you've seen the TV show *Intervention*, you might think it's about ambushing someone, cornering them, and forcing them into treatment. And while that *can* be part of intervention work, it's not the whole story‚Äîand in the Core Values model, it's not even the preferred approach.

Here's how we define intervention:

**Intervention is a *guided process* in which a network of caring individuals invites a person struggling with addiction to accept help and enter recovery.**

Notice the key words:
- **Guided process** ‚Äî It's not spontaneous or chaotic. It's planned, structured, and facilitated.
- **Network of caring individuals** ‚Äî It's not one person vs. the Pivot Person. It's a team offering collective love and support.
- **Invites** ‚Äî Even in the most structured interventions, we're *inviting*, not forcing. The Pivot Person always has agency.
- **Accept help** ‚Äî We're not rescuing them. We're creating an opportunity for *them* to choose recovery.

At its core, intervention is about **moving families from crisis to connection**. It's about transforming the chaotic, desperate energy of 'We don't know what to do!' into a coordinated, loving plan that says, 'We see you. We love you. We're here to help. Will you let us?'"

---

### **SCRIPT 1.2.B: What Intervention Is NOT**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's be clear about what intervention is **not**:

‚ùå **It's not punishment.** We're not shaming or attacking the Pivot Person.

‚ùå **It's not an ultimatum.** While consequences may be part of the conversation, the goal is invitation, not coercion.

‚ùå **It's not a one-time magic fix.** Intervention is a doorway to recovery, not the end of the journey.

‚ùå **It's not about controlling the Pivot Person.** It's about empowering the *family* to stop enabling and start supporting healthy choices.

‚ùå **It's not only for 'rock bottom.'** You don't have to wait until someone loses everything to intervene. In fact, earlier intervention often has better outcomes.

If you remember one thing from today, let it be this: **Intervention, done well, is an act of love.** Everything else flows from that truth."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.2.C: The Three Pillars (Awareness, Coordination, Care)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"The Core Values model of intervention rests on three pillars: **Awareness, Coordination, and Care**. These three pillars are the structure that holds everything together.

**Pillar 1: AWARENESS**
- The family develops awareness of how addiction operates as a disease and a system
- They become aware of their own enabling patterns and the roles they've been playing
- They learn the language of dignity and connection

**Pillar 2: COORDINATION**
- The family moves from chaos to intentional coordination
- They assess the situation, choose an intervention mode, and organize a team
- They create a plan with clear roles, messages, and next steps

**Pillar 3: CARE**
- The family approaches the Pivot Person with care‚Äîgrounded in love, not fear or anger
- They care for themselves by setting boundaries and practicing self-care
- They care for the long-term by committing to recovery as a family process, not just a one-time event

Without all three pillars, interventions collapse. Awareness without coordination is just talk. Coordination without care becomes coercion. Care without awareness enables. All three together create a solid foundation for change."

---

## DAY 1, SESSION 1.3: NATURE OF RECOVERY

### **SCRIPT 1.3.A: Addiction as a Disease (Brain Science)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's talk about what's actually happening in the brain of someone with a substance use disorder.

Addiction is a **chronic, relapsing brain disease**. That's not a metaphor‚Äîit's neuroscience. Here's what happens:

When someone uses a substance‚Äîalcohol, opioids, stimulants‚Äîthe brain floods with dopamine, a chemical that signals 'This is important! Do this again!' Over time, the brain adapts. It down-regulates dopamine receptors to compensate for the flood, which means:
1. The person needs *more* of the substance to get the same effect (tolerance)
2. Normal pleasures (food, relationships, hobbies) stop feeling rewarding (anhedonia)
3. The brain's decision-making center (prefrontal cortex) weakens, making it harder to resist cravings

The result? The person's brain is literally hijacked. Their brain is screaming, 'I need this to survive!' even though the substance is killing them.

This is why **willpower alone doesn't work**. You can't just 'decide' to overcome a brain disease any more than you can decide to cure diabetes. Recovery requires *treatment*‚Äîtherapy, support, sometimes medication, and a complete restructuring of life.

When we understand this, we stop blaming the Pivot Person for 'choosing' addiction. They're not weak or bad‚Äîthey're sick. And sickness requires care, not condemnation."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.3.B: Recovery is a Lifelong Process**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Here's a hard truth: **Recovery doesn't end when treatment ends.**

Treatment‚Äîwhether it's 30 days inpatient, 90 days outpatient, or six months in sober living‚Äîis just the beginning. Recovery is a lifelong process of learning to live without substances, healing the underlying wounds that fueled the addiction, and building a life worth staying sober for.

We say at Core Values: **Recovery is not a destination. It's a direction.**

What does that mean practically?
- Relapse is *common*. It doesn't mean failure‚Äîit means the person needs more support or a different approach.
- The family's role doesn't end at the treatment center door. Recovery is a family process. Everyone heals together.
- Recovery requires ongoing support: 12-step meetings, therapy, sober community, accountability, purpose.

The intervention you facilitate is the doorway. But the family has to walk through it and keep walking‚Äîday after day, year after year. That's why our work as interventionists includes preparing families for the long haul, not just the immediate crisis."

---

## DAY 1, SESSION 1.4: SYSTEMS THINKING

### **SCRIPT 1.4.A: Introduction to Family Systems**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Addiction doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in a *system*‚Äîa family, a workplace, a social network. And here's the key insight of systems thinking: **When one person in the system changes their behavior, everyone else has to adjust.**

Imagine a family as a mobile‚Äîyou know, those hanging sculptures where everything is balanced. When one piece moves, the whole mobile shifts to find a new balance.

In a family affected by addiction, the mobile has been arranged around the Pivot Person's substance use. Everyone has adapted their behavior to cope:
- The spouse covers for them at work
- The kids learn not to bring friends home
- The parent pays their bills when they can't
- The sibling becomes the 'responsible one' to compensate

This is the system's way of achieving *homeostasis*‚Äîbalance, even if it's dysfunctional balance.

Now, when we intervene, we're trying to disrupt that balance. We're saying, 'This system is keeping everyone sick. We need to reorganize around *health*, not around the addiction.'

That's why intervention isn't just about the Pivot Person. It's about helping the *whole system* shift toward recovery."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.4.B: Family Roles in Addiction (The Cast of Characters)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"In families affected by addiction, people often fall into predictable roles. These roles are unconscious coping mechanisms‚Äîways of surviving in a chaotic system. Let's meet the cast of characters:

**1. The Enabler** (Often a spouse or parent)
- Covers up consequences, makes excuses, rescues the Pivot Person
- Motivation: Love, fear of loss, guilt
- Impact: Prevents the Pivot Person from experiencing natural consequences, which keeps the addiction alive

**2. The Hero** (Often the oldest child or high-achieving sibling)
- Overachieves to compensate for the family's dysfunction
- Motivation: 'If I'm successful enough, maybe I can fix this'
- Impact: Burnout, resentment, and a belief that their worth is tied to performance

**3. The Scapegoat** (Often a younger child or rebellious family member)
- Acts out, gets in trouble, draws negative attention
- Motivation: 'If I'm the problem, no one will notice the real problem'
- Impact: Becomes the family's 'identified patient,' distracting from the addiction

**4. The Lost Child** (Often the middle or quiet child)
- Withdraws, stays invisible, doesn't make waves
- Motivation: 'If I don't ask for anything, I won't add to the chaos'
- Impact: Loneliness, unmet needs, difficulty forming close relationships

**5. The Mascot** (Often the youngest or the family comedian)
- Uses humor and distraction to ease tension
- Motivation: 'If I can make everyone laugh, maybe we'll be okay'
- Impact: Difficulty processing emotions, anxiety masked by humor

These roles are survival strategies. They helped people cope. But in recovery, we invite people to *step out* of these roles and into healthier, more authentic ways of being."

---

## DAY 1, SESSION 1.5: LANGUAGE WORKSHOP

### **SCRIPT 1.5.A: Why Language Matters**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's talk about words.

The language we use in intervention work isn't just political correctness or semantic fussiness. **Language shapes reality.** It affects how the Pivot Person sees themselves, how families understand addiction, and whether people feel invited into recovery or shamed away from it.

Here's a simple test: Which of these sentences feels more invitational?

A) 'You're an addict. You need help.'
B) 'You're struggling with substance use. We're here to support you in getting help.'

Most people choose B. Why? Because:
- It focuses on the *behavior* (substance use) rather than defining the *person* (addict)
- It's collaborative ('we're here') rather than accusatory
- It's invitational ('support you') rather than directive ('you need')

At Core Values, we've chosen language intentionally to create dignity, reduce shame, and open doors to connection. Let me walk you through our core terms."

---

### **SCRIPT 1.5.B: Core Values Language Choices**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Here are the key language shifts we make in Core Values intervention work:

**SAY THIS ‚Üí NOT THAT**

**'Pivot Person'** ‚Üí *Not 'addict,' 'alcoholic,' 'user'*
- Why: 'Pivot Person' emphasizes *agency*‚Äîthis is someone who can pivot toward health. It's not an identity; it's a moment of choice.

**'Substance use disorder' or 'struggling with addiction'** ‚Üí *Not 'drug habit' or 'addiction problem'*
- Why: Person-first language ('person with a disorder') rather than identity-first language ('addict')

**'Healthy Choices'** ‚Üí *Not 'boundaries'*
- Why: 'Boundaries' can feel punitive. 'Healthy Choices' emphasizes the family's agency and self-care.

**'Concerned Persons' or 'Care Team'** ‚Üí *Not 'loved ones' or 'family'*
- Why: Not all families are loving, and not all care teams are family. 'Concerned Persons' is neutral and inclusive.

**'Treatment' or 'recovery support'** ‚Üí *Not 'rehab'*
- Why: 'Rehab' is colloquial and often stigmatized. 'Treatment' is clinical and dignified.

**'Relapse'** ‚Üí *Not 'failure' or 'fell off the wagon'*
- Why: Relapse is a common part of recovery. It's a medical event, not a moral failing.

**'Recovery is a Team Sport'** ‚Üí *Core Values Tagline*
- Why: It reminds everyone that recovery involves the whole system, not just the Pivot Person.

Use this language *everywhere*‚Äîin your assessments, in your facilitation, in your Impact Letters. It matters."

---

## DAY 2: COORDINATION SCRIPTS

## DAY 2, SESSION 2.2: ROLES & BOUNDARIES

### **SCRIPT 2.2.A: The Interventionist's Role (Guide, Not Guru)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's start with a fundamental question: *What is the interventionist's role?*

In the Core Values model, the interventionist is **a guide, not a guru**. You are not:
- The family therapist (though you may refer them to one)
- The treatment center (though you help them access one)
- The person who 'fixes' the Pivot Person
- The hero who swoops in with all the answers

You ARE:
- **A skilled facilitator** who creates safe space for hard conversations
- **An educator** who helps families understand addiction and recovery
- **A coordinator** who organizes the team and process
- **A compassionate witness** who holds hope when the family can't

Let me share a metaphor that helps: Think of yourself as a **sherpa on a mountain climb**. You know the terrain, you've been up this mountain before, you have the skills and tools. But the family is doing the climbing. Your job is to guide them safely, point out hazards, suggest paths, and carry some of the load‚Äîbut ultimately, *they* take each step."

---

### **SCRIPT 2.2.B: Boundaries: The Mother Scenario**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Case Example]**

"Here's a common scenario you'll encounter:

A mother calls you and says, **'My son won't listen to me anymore. Will you come to my house and tell him he needs to go to treatment?'**

Pause. What's happening here?

The mother is asking you to be the *authority*‚Äîthe person who tells her son what to do. She wants you to take over the relationship and do what she feels she can't do.

How do you respond?

Here's what *not* to say:
‚ùå 'Sure, I'll come tell him.'
‚ùå 'He's not going to listen to me either if he won't listen to you.'

Here's what *to* say:
‚úÖ **'I hear how painful this is for you‚Äîfeeling like he won't listen. I want to help, but not by replacing your voice. You are his mother, and your words carry more weight than mine ever could. What I *can* do is help you figure out *how* to say what you need to say in a way he might be able to hear. Would you be open to that?'**

What does this do?
- It validates her pain ('I hear how painful this is')
- It reframes the problem (not that she's powerless, but that she needs tools)
- It keeps her in the primary role (her relationship with her son)
- It positions you as the guide, not the guru

This is boundary-setting with compassion. Practice it. You'll need it."

---

## DAY 2, SESSION 2.4: TOOLS OF INTERVENTION

### **SCRIPT 2.4.A: Impact Letters Introduction**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Impact Letters are one of the most powerful tools in intervention work. They are written messages from Concerned Persons to the Pivot Person, read aloud during a structured intervention (Modes 2 or 3 primarily).

But here's what they are NOT:
- ‚ùå A list of grievances or complaints
- ‚ùå A guilt trip or shame session
- ‚ùå An ultimatum or threat
- ‚ùå A venting session for the writer

They ARE:
- ‚úÖ A loving, honest expression of concern
- ‚úÖ Specific examples of impact (behavior ‚Üí consequence)
- ‚úÖ An invitation to accept help
- ‚úÖ A statement of commitment to support recovery"

---

### **SCRIPT 2.4.B: Sample Opening Script for Mode 2 Intervention**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Intervention Meeting Opening]**

*"[Pivot Person's name], thank you for being here. I know this might feel surprising or even uncomfortable, and I want you to know that everyone in this room is here because they love you.*

*My name is [your name], and I'm an intervention specialist. I've been working with your family over the past [timeframe] to prepare for this conversation. This is not an attack or an ambush‚Äîthis is an invitation.*

*We're going to spend the next [30-45 minutes] sharing with you how your substance use has impacted the people who care about you most. Each person has written you a letter, and they're going to read it to you. Your job is just to listen. You don't have to respond or defend yourself‚Äîjust receive what they're offering you, which is their truth and their love.*

*After everyone has shared, we'll talk about a treatment option that we believe can help you. And then you'll have a choice to make.*

*Does that make sense? Do you have any questions before we begin?"*

---

## DAY 3: CARE SCRIPTS

## DAY 3, SESSION 3.4: TiPS DEBRIEF

### **SCRIPT 3.4.A: TiPS Framework Introduction**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"This morning you stepped into some emotionally intense scenarios. Before we dive into analysis and ethics, I want to create space to *process* what came up for you.

We're going to use a framework called **TiPS‚ÄîTrauma-Informed Practice Strategies**‚Äîto debrief. This ensures we're not just talking about *what happened* in the simulations, but also tending to *how it affected us*.

TiPS stands for:
- **T = Thoughts** (What are you thinking about the experience?)
- **I = Impacts** (How did this affect you emotionally or physically?)
- **P = Patterns** (What patterns did you notice?)
- **S = Supports** (What support do you need moving forward?)

We'll go through each one together."

---

## DAY 3, SESSION 3.5: ETHICS DEEP DIVE

### **SCRIPT 3.5.A: Scenario 1 - The Pressured Intervention (Teaching)**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - After group discussion]**

"Here's what I want you to take away from this scenario:

**Urgency does not equal emergency.**

The mother is anxious. She's terrified her son will die. She's looking at the calendar and thinking, 'The whole family will be in town‚Äîthis is my shot.' I understand that. Her fear is real.

But here's the question: **Will a rushed, pressured intervention in the wrong mode actually help the son, or will it make things worse?**

If the son is in Precontemplation (not considering change) and relational capacity is low (strained family relationships), a surprise intervention is likely to backfire. He'll feel ambushed, shut down, and refuse help. Now the family has burned their bridge‚Äîand the son is even less likely to trust them next time.

The ethical choice here is to **hold the boundary**. You say to the mother:

‚úÖ *'I understand your urgency, and I share your concern for your son's safety. But based on my assessment, a surprise intervention this weekend carries a high risk of failure. I believe a collaborative approach over the next several weeks will give him the best chance of saying yes to treatment. I know that feels slow and scary. But I'd rather take the time to do this right than rush and lose the opportunity altogether. I'm here to support you through that process. Are you willing to trust me on this?'*

If she says no and finds someone else, that's her choice. **You cannot compromise your integrity or the Pivot Person's best interest because a family is anxious.** Your job is to guide, not to comply.

Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is say no to a family and hold the line for what serves the Pivot Person best. That takes courage."

---

## DAY 3, SESSION 3.7: CLOSING CEREMONY

### **SCRIPT 3.7.A: Closing Blessing**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Final Words]**

"Before we part ways, I want to leave you with this:

Intervention work is sacred. You are walking into the most painful, terrifying moments of a family's life and saying, *'I see you. I'm here. There is hope.'*

That is holy work.

You will not do it perfectly. You will make mistakes. You will have interventions that don't go the way you planned. You will feel inadequate sometimes.

But you are *enough*. You have been trained. You have the framework. You have the heart. And you have a community of mentors and peers who will walk with you.

Go forward with courage, compassion, and care. Trust that the families who need you will find you. And when they do, show up fully.

The world needs you. The families drowning in addiction need you. The Pivot Persons who have lost hope need you.

Thank you for saying yes to this work. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for being here."

**[PAUSE]**

"Let's take one final breath together. [INHALE] Breathe in courage. [EXHALE] Release fear. You are ready.

Go in peace. Go with courage. Go with love. And I'll see you in the mentorship program. You're dismissed."
