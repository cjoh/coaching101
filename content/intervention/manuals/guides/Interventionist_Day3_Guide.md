## SESSION 3.1: MORNING CHECK-IN & INTENTION-SETTING
**‚è∞ Time:** 9:00‚Äì9:30 AM (30 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Ground the group, acknowledge readiness and nervousness, set intentions for practice day

### 9:00-9:05 ‚Äî WELCOME & CENTERING (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Good morning, and welcome to Day 3‚Äîour final day together in this intensive training.

Today is about *Care*‚Äîcaring for the Pivot Person, caring for the family, and caring for ourselves as we do this sacred, difficult work.

You're going to practice today. You're going to step into the role of interventionist and family members. You're going to make mistakes, feel awkward, surprise yourself with your skill, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîyou're going to *learn*.

Before we dive into the simulations, let's ground ourselves in why we're here."

**[PAUSE - Breath practice]**

"Take a deep breath with me. [INHALE] Hold. [EXHALE slowly]. One more. [INHALE] This work requires presence. [EXHALE] Let's be here fully today."

### 9:05-9:20 ‚Äî REFLECTION & SHARING (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Invitation]**

"I'd like to go around the circle this morning with a different kind of check-in. Share:

1. **Why** you're doing this work. What brought you to intervention? What are you hoping to offer families?
2. **One intention** you're setting for today's practice.

We'll go one at a time. This isn't a time for discussion‚Äîjust witness each other's 'why.' I'll start."

**[FACILITATOR MODELS FIRST]**

Example:
*"I'm doing this work because I've seen too many families suffer in silence, not knowing how to help someone they love. I lost a friend to addiction before I knew intervention was even possible. My intention today is to practice staying grounded when the role-play gets intense, and to trust that I have what I need inside me to guide with compassion."*

**[GO AROUND CIRCLE - Allow 30-60 seconds per person]**

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Listen deeply; this is sacred ground
- Tissue box nearby (emotions may arise)
- Notice themes: personal loss, calling to serve, desire to help
- Affirm each person's "why" with a nod or "thank you"

### 9:20-9:30 ‚Äî DAY 3 ROADMAP & SIMULATION OVERVIEW (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Orientation]**

"Thank you for sharing your hearts. That's the fuel for this work‚Äîyour 'why' will carry you through the hard moments.

Here's how today will unfold:

**Morning (9:30 AM‚Äì12:30 PM):**
- **30 minutes:** Final case study preparation and rehearsal in your groups
- **2.5 hours:** Role-play simulations (each group runs their full intervention‚Äî30-40 minutes each, plus debrief)

**Afternoon (1:30 PM‚Äì5:00 PM):**
- **Trauma-Informed Debrief:** We'll process what came up using the TiPS framework
- **Ethics Deep Dive:** Navigate complex ethical scenarios together
- **Mentorship Overview:** What happens after today (40-week program structure)
- **Closing Ceremony:** Honor your learning and commitment

**A few guidelines for the simulations:**

1. **Play full out.** Commit to your role. The more real you make it, the more you'll learn.
2. **Stay in character** during the simulation. Save processing for the debrief.
3. **Take care of yourself.** If something feels too triggering, you can step out and signal me. No shame in that.
4. **Observe with compassion.** When you're watching other groups, use the observation rubric to give constructive feedback‚Äîbut lead with what's working.
5. **Mistakes are data.** You're *supposed* to mess up. That's how we learn.

Questions before we begin?"

**[ANSWER QUESTIONS - 2-3 minutes]**

**[TRANSITION]**

"Alright. Let's get to work. Groups, head to your spaces for final preparation. We'll reconvene at 10:00 AM for the first simulation."

---

## SESSION 3.2: CASE STUDY PREPARATION & REHEARSAL
**‚è∞ Time:** 9:30‚Äì10:00 AM (30 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Final preparation and rehearsal before simulations

### 9:30-10:00 ‚Äî GROUP PREPARATION TIME (30 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Instructions to Groups]**

"You have 30 minutes to finalize your intervention plan and do a quick run-through. Here's what you should accomplish:

**Step 1: Review Your Plan (5 minutes)**

---

## SESSION 3.3: ROLE-PLAY SIMULATIONS
**‚è∞ Time:** 10:00 AM‚Äì12:30 PM (150 minutes total: 3 simulations √ó 50 minutes each)
**üéØ Purpose:** Full intervention simulation practice with immediate debrief

**Structure per Simulation:**
- **30-40 minutes:** Role-play (let it run its natural course)
- **10-15 minutes:** Immediate debrief (TiPS framework)
- **5 minutes:** Transition and reset for next group

---

### SIMULATION 1: MARTINEZ FAMILY (Mode 1 - Collaborative Invitation)
**‚è∞ Time:** 10:00‚Äì10:50 AM (50 minutes)

**[PRE-SIMULATION SETUP - 5 minutes before start]**

**Facilitator Instructions:**
- Gather all participants in the simulation space
- Observers sit in outer circle with Observation Rubrics
- Simulation participants arrange seating (family circle, interventionist chair)
- Confirm roles and readiness

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Launching the Simulation]**

"Martinez Family group, you're up. Everyone else, you're observers. Your job is to watch with compassion and take notes on the rubric‚Äîwe'll use this for feedback in a moment.

Martinez group: You've prepared for this. Trust your plan, trust each other, and trust that you know more than you think you do. When you're ready, begin. I'll be in the back corner‚ÄîI won't interrupt unless there's a safety concern.

Go."

**[SIMULATION RUNS - 30-40 minutes]**

**Facilitator Role During Simulation:**
- Observe silently from the back of the room
- Take notes on key moments (facilitation strengths, challenges, breakthroughs)
- Monitor participants' emotional state (watch for signs of distress)
- Time-keep (give a 5-minute warning if needed: "5 minutes remaining")
- Do NOT interrupt unless absolutely necessary (safety, completely off-track)

**What to Watch For:**
- Does the interventionist set a clear, invitational tone?
- Are Impact Letters specific, loving, and non-blaming?
- How does the "Pivot Person" respond? (Defensive, receptive, emotional?)
- Does the facilitator manage the process effectively?
- Are participants staying in character?

**[END SIMULATION]**

"And scene. Thank you, Martinez Family group. Let's pause there."

**[IMMEDIATE DEBRIEF - 10-15 minutes]**

**Step 1: Break Character (1 minute)**

"Everyone, take a breath and step out of character. Shake it off physically if you need to‚Äîthis is role-play, not reality. You're back to being yourselves."

**[PAUSE - Allow participants to physically reset]**

**Step 2: Check In with "Pivot Person" (2 minutes)**

"[Name], you played Carlos, the Pivot Person. How are you doing? What was that like for you?"

**Listen for:** Emotional impact, feeling attacked vs. loved, what worked/didn't work

**Step 3: Check In with Interventionist (3 minutes)**

"[Name], you facilitated this intervention. What was it like to be in that role? What felt hard? What surprised you?"

**Listen for:** Confidence, uncertainty, moments of skillfulness, desire for feedback

**Step 4: Observer Feedback (5 minutes)**

"Observers, what did you notice? Let's start with **one thing that worked really well**‚Äîsomething the interventionist or the family did that felt effective."

**[TAKE 2-3 COMMENTS]**

"Now, **one thing to consider or adjust** for next time. Frame it as a learning edge, not a criticism."

**[TAKE 2-3 COMMENTS]**

**Step 5: Facilitator Reflection (3 minutes)**

**[FACILITATOR OFFERS OBSERVATIONS]**

**Template:**
*"Here's what I noticed: [Name specific strengths‚Äîe.g., "The way you opened with clarity and warmth," "The Impact Letters were specific and loving"]. Here's one thing to think about: [Name one learning edge‚Äîe.g., "When Carlos got defensive, you could have paused and validated his feelings before moving forward"]. Overall, you did [summarize key success]. Well done."*

**[TRANSITION - 2 minutes]**

"Thank you, Martinez Family group. You just did something brave. Let's reset the space for the Thompson Family. 5-minute break."

---

### SIMULATION 2: THOMPSON FAMILY (Mode 2 - Structured Invitation)
**‚è∞ Time:** 11:00‚Äì11:50 AM (50 minutes)

**[REPEAT STRUCTURE FROM SIMULATION 1]**

**Facilitation Notes Specific to Thompson Family:**
- This is a Mode 2 (Structured Invitation), so watch for:
  - More structure and formality in the meeting
  - Impact Letters with clear examples of Jennifer's denial
  - Immediate treatment option presented at the end
  - Facilitator managing Jennifer's potential defensiveness or intellectualization

**Debrief Focus Questions:**
- How did the structure feel different from Mode 1?
- Was the tone firm but loving, or did it tip into confrontation?
- How did the interventionist handle Jennifer's denial?

---

### SIMULATION 3: CHEN FAMILY (Mode 4 - Ad-Hoc Crisis Intervention)
**‚è∞ Time:** 12:00‚Äì12:50 PM (50 minutes)

**[REPEAT STRUCTURE FROM SIMULATION 1]**

**Facilitation Notes Specific to Chen Family:**
- This is a Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc Crisis), so watch for:
  - High urgency and emotional intensity
  - Flexibility in approach (this is unplanned, so it may feel chaotic)
  - Trauma-informed response to David's recent suicide attempt
  - Balancing urgency with building trust

**Debrief Focus Questions:**
- How did the crisis context change the facilitation approach?
- Was the interventionist able to stay grounded in the chaos?
- How did trauma-informed principles show up (or not)?

**[END OF MORNING SIMULATIONS - 12:50 PM]**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Transition to Lunch]**

"We've just completed three full intervention simulations. You all showed up with courage, skill, and heart. I'm really proud of the work you did this morning.

Let's break for lunch. We'll reconvene at 1:30 PM for a deeper debrief and our ethics discussion. Take care of yourselves during lunch‚Äîthis work is intense. Eat, hydrate, get some air if you need it.

See you at 1:30."

---

## LUNCH BREAK
**‚è∞ Time:** 12:50‚Äì1:30 PM (40 minutes)

**Facilitator Tasks During Lunch:**
- Check in with any participants who seemed particularly affected by the role-plays
- Prepare ethics scenario cards for afternoon session
- Set up debrief space (circle seating, comfortable environment)
- Review afternoon agenda and time management

---

## SESSION 3.4: TRAUMA-INFORMED DEBRIEF
**‚è∞ Time:** 1:30‚Äì2:30 PM (60 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Process the simulations using trauma-informed framework, integrate learning

### 1:30-1:35 ‚Äî WELCOME BACK & GROUNDING (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Welcome back. This morning you stepped into some emotionally intense scenarios. Before we dive into analysis and ethics, I want to create space to *process* what came up for you.

We're going to use a framework called **TiPS‚ÄîTrauma-Informed Practice Strategies**‚Äîto debrief. This ensures we're not just talking about *what happened* in the simulations, but also tending to *how it affected us*.

Let's ground ourselves first."

**[GROUNDING PRACTICE - 2 minutes]**

**Option 1: Body Scan**
"Close your eyes if comfortable. Bring your awareness to your feet on the floor. [PAUSE] Notice your breath. [PAUSE] Scan your body for any tension‚Äîshoulders, jaw, stomach. [PAUSE] Take a deep breath and release. [EXHALE] Open your eyes when ready."

**Option 2: 5-4-3-2-1 Technique**
"Let's ground using our senses. Look around and name:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

This brings us back to the present moment, here and now."

### 1:35-2:00 ‚Äî TiPS DEBRIEF FRAMEWORK (25 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching + Process]**

"TiPS stands for **Thoughts, Impacts, Patterns, Supports**. We'll go through each one together."

**[FLIP CHART - Write framework as you teach]**

---

#### **T = THOUGHTS** (What are you thinking about the experience?)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Let's start with thoughts. As you reflect on the simulations, what are you *thinking*‚Äîabout your performance, about intervention work, about what you learned?

Turn to a partner and share one thought. 2 minutes each."

**[PAIR SHARE - 4 minutes]**

**[FULL GROUP - 2 minutes]**

"Anyone willing to share a thought with the whole group?"

**Listen for:** Self-criticism, insights, surprises, comparisons

---

#### **I = IMPACTS** (How did this affect you emotionally or physically?)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Now let's go deeper. How did the simulations *impact* you? Did anything feel triggering, activating, or emotionally challenging? Did you notice physical sensations‚Äîtension, tears, tightness in your chest?

This is a brave space. It's okay to name hard things."

**[SILENT REFLECTION - 2 minutes]**

"Take a moment to write in your journal or just sit with this question."

**[INVITE SHARING - 5 minutes]**

"Would anyone like to share an impact‚Äîsomething that affected you emotionally or physically?"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Normalize emotional responses ("It makes sense that...")
- Affirm vulnerability ("Thank you for sharing that")
- Watch for participants who may need 1:1 support after session
- Don't push anyone to share‚Äîsilence is okay

---

#### **P = PATTERNS** (What patterns did you notice?)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Let's shift to patterns. Across the three simulations, what did you notice happening again and again?

This could be:
- Patterns in how families respond
- Patterns in your own facilitation style
- Patterns in what works or doesn't work
- Patterns in group dynamics"

**[SMALL GROUPS - 5 minutes]**

"In groups of 3-4, discuss: What patterns did you notice? I'll give you 5 minutes, then we'll share."

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

**Common Patterns to Surface:**
- Defensive Pivot Person ‚Üí Facilitator validates feelings before redirecting
- Family members talk *about* Pivot Person instead of *to* them ‚Üí Coaching language
- Interventionist rushes through discomfort ‚Üí Practice slowing down and holding space
- Love gets lost in the structure ‚Üí Return to "why" (love and connection)

---

#### **S = SUPPORTS** (What support do you need moving forward?)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Final piece: Supports. As you prepare to do this work in the real world, what support do you need?

This could be:
- Peer consultation or supervision
- Your own therapy or recovery support
- Mentorship and skill-building (which we'll talk about next)
- Boundaries and self-care practices"

**[INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION - 2 minutes]**

"Write down 1-2 supports you know you'll need."

**[INVITE SHARING - 3 minutes]**

"Anyone want to name a support you need? Saying it out loud is part of creating accountability for yourself."

### 2:00-2:30 ‚Äî INTEGRATION & KEY TAKEAWAYS (30 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Synthesis]**

"Thank you for engaging so deeply with the TiPS debrief. I want to pull out some key takeaways from this morning's simulations and name what I saw."

**[FACILITATOR TEACHING - 10 minutes]**

**Key Takeaways (Customize based on what you observed):**

1. **Presence Over Perfection**
   - "You don't need to have all the answers. Your job is to be *present*‚Äîcalm, grounded, and compassionate. I saw that in [specific example]."

2. **Love is the Container**
   - "The families you serve are terrified, grief-stricken, and desperate. Your role is to hold them in love while you guide the process. I saw that when [specific example]."

3. **Flexibility Within Structure**
   - "Mode 2 has structure, but it's not rigid. You have to adapt in real time. [Name] did this beautifully when [specific example]."

4. **Trauma-Informed Care is Essential**
   - "Addiction is trauma. Family systems are often traumatized. Every intervention must account for this. Notice when someone is activated and slow down."

5. **You Are Ready‚ÄîAnd You'll Keep Learning**
   - "You've learned a tremendous amount in three days. But intervention is a *practice*. You'll learn more in your first real intervention than in any training. Trust that you'll grow."

**[ACTIVITY - Paired Reflection: 10 minutes]**

"Find a partner. Share:
1. One thing you're taking away from this morning's practice.
2. One skill you want to keep developing.

5 minutes each."

**[CLOSING REFLECTION - 10 minutes]**

"Let's come back together. I'd love to hear from a few people‚Äîwhat's one skill you want to keep developing?"

**[INVITE 4-5 SHARES]**

**Facilitator Affirmation:**
"I heard: [name themes]. Here's what I know to be true‚Äîyou are all capable of this work. You have the heart, the skills, and the framework. What you need now is practice, support, and ongoing learning. That's what the mentorship program is for, and we'll talk about that soon.

But first, let's dive into ethics."

---

## SESSION 3.5: ETHICS DEEP DIVE
**‚è∞ Time:** 2:30‚Äì3:30 PM (60 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Navigate complex ethical scenarios, deepen ethical grounding

### 2:30-2:40 ‚Äî ETHICS FRAMEWORK REVIEW (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"We've talked about ethics throughout this training‚Äîthe Four Questions, dignity-centered language, boundaries, and trauma-informed care. Now we're going to wrestle with some hard scenarios.

Let's review the ethical foundation first."

**[FLIP CHART - Review from Day 1 & Day 2]**

**Core Ethical Principles:**
1. **Love as the Foundation** ‚Äî Every intervention must be rooted in love, not control or punishment
2. **Dignity Always** ‚Äî The Pivot Person's humanity is never negotiable
3. **Family-Centered** ‚Äî This is the family's process; you are the guide
4. **Transparency** ‚Äî No hidden agendas, financial conflicts, or manipulation
5. **Do No Harm** ‚Äî If an intervention could make things worse, don't do it
6. **Cultural Humility** ‚Äî Respect family culture, values, and context
7. **Boundaries** ‚Äî Stay in your lane; know when to refer out

**[PAUSE]**

"These principles sound simple. In practice, they're messy. Let's explore that messiness together."

### 2:40-3:20 ‚Äî ETHICS SCENARIO DISCUSSION (40 minutes)

**[FACILITATION STRUCTURE]**

**Instructions:**
"I'm going to give you four ethical scenarios. We'll discuss each one as a full group. For each scenario, ask yourself:
1. What's the ethical dilemma here?
2. What do the Four Questions reveal?
3. What would you do, and why?"

---

#### **SCENARIO 1: The Pressured Intervention**

**[READ ALOUD]**

*"A mother calls you and says her 28-year-old son has been using heroin for two years. She's terrified he's going to die. She says, 'I need you to do an intervention this weekend‚Äîhis grandmother is dying and the whole family will be in town. It's the perfect time.' You assess the situation and determine the son is in Precontemplation, safety is moderate (6/10), and relational capacity is low (3/10). You recommend Mode 1 (Collaborative) over several weeks to build trust and readiness. The mother says, 'I don't have several weeks. His grandmother might not make it to next month. If you won't do it this weekend, I'll find someone who will.'"*

**What do you do?**

**[SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION - 5 minutes]**

"Talk in your groups: What's the ethical issue? What would you do?"

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Urgency ‚â† Emergency (grandmother's death is sad, but not a safety crisis)
- Mother's anxiety is driving timeline, not best practice
- Risk of ineffective intervention: son may refuse, family burns the bridge
- Ethical choice: Hold the boundary, educate the mother, offer Mode 1 or refer out
- **Core principle violated if you proceed:** Do No Harm (likely to make things worse)

**Facilitator Wisdom:**
*"Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is say no to a family and hold the line for what serves the Pivot Person best. That takes courage."*

---

#### **SCENARIO 2: The Financial Conflict**

**[READ ALOUD]**

*"You're hired by a family to facilitate an intervention for their adult daughter. In your initial consultation, the father mentions that he owns a treatment center in another state and asks if you'd be willing to transport her there if she agrees to treatment. He says, 'I'll pay your fee plus a $2,000 bonus if you get her into my facility.' The treatment center is reputable and appropriate for her needs."*

**What do you do?**

**[SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION - 5 minutes]**

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Financial conflict of interest: You benefit from placement at *his* facility
- Bonus structure creates perverse incentive (pressure to recommend his facility regardless of fit)
- Ethical choice: Decline the bonus, present multiple treatment options, let family decide
- Transparency: Disclose the father's ownership to the daughter if she doesn't know
- **Core principle violated:** Transparency, Do No Harm (your judgment is compromised)

**Facilitator Wisdom:**
*"If someone is paying you extra to steer the outcome a certain way, you're no longer a guide‚Äîyou're a salesperson. Don't compromise your integrity for money."*

---

#### **SCENARIO 3: The Dangerous Surprise**

**[READ ALOUD]**

*"A family wants to do a Mode 3 (Planned Surprise) intervention for their 45-year-old brother, who has been using methamphetamine and alcohol. In your assessment, you learn that he has a history of violent outbursts when confronted, owns firearms, and has made threats against family members in the past. The family insists, 'He'll never agree to a collaborative intervention. We have to surprise him or he won't come.' They're willing to proceed."*

**What do you do?**

**[SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION - 5 minutes]**

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Safety risk is too high for surprise intervention (violence, firearms)
- Family's urgency doesn't override safety assessment
- Ethical choice: Decline Mode 3, recommend Mode 4 (crisis-based with professional support) or Mode 5 (individual outreach)
- Alternative: Coordinate with law enforcement, mental health professionals, or wait for a crisis opportunity
- **Core principle violated:** Do No Harm (high risk of violence or trauma)

**Facilitator Wisdom:**
*"Your safety and the family's safety come first. If an intervention could endanger lives, don't do it. There are other pathways."*

---

#### **SCENARIO 4: The Ambivalent Pivot Person**

**[READ ALOUD]**

*"During a Mode 2 intervention, the Pivot Person (a 33-year-old woman with opioid use disorder) listens to all the Impact Letters, cries, and says, 'I know I need help. I'm just not sure if I'm ready to leave my kids for 30 days. Can I think about it and decide tomorrow?' The family looks to you for guidance. You know that delaying often leads to the Pivot Person backing out."*

**What do you do?**

**[SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION - 5 minutes]**

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Tension between honoring autonomy and leveraging the moment
- Ambivalence is normal; pressure can tip either way (toward yes or away)
- Ethical approach: Validate her concern (kids are important), explore the fear ("What feels hardest about leaving?"), offer compromise (shorter program, family visits, phone calls)
- Gentle urgency: "Treatment centers don't hold beds indefinitely. We have one ready for you today. What would help you say yes?"
- Respect her ultimate choice, but don't collude with avoidance
- **Core principle:** Dignity Always (honor her agency while creating accountability)

**Facilitator Wisdom:**
*"You can hold the tension between urgency and autonomy. Don't force, but don't enable delay. Stay curious, compassionate, and clear."*

---

### 3:20-3:30 ‚Äî ETHICS INTEGRATION (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Synthesis]**

"These scenarios are hard because there's no perfect answer. That's the reality of intervention work‚Äîyou're navigating complexity, fear, love, and desperation all at once.

Here's what I want you to remember:

**When you're facing an ethical dilemma, do this:**
1. **Pause.** Don't make decisions under pressure.
2. **Return to the Four Questions.** Let them guide you.
3. **Consult.** Call a peer, supervisor, or mentor. You don't have to decide alone.
4. **Trust your gut.** If something feels wrong, it probably is.
5. **Document.** Keep records of your reasoning and decision-making process.

You will face ethical gray zones in this work. Your integrity is your anchor. Protect it fiercely."

**[TRANSITION]**

"Let's take a 10-minute break, and then we'll talk about what comes next‚Äîthe mentorship program that will support you as you begin this work."

## SESSION 3.7: CLOSING CEREMONY
**‚è∞ Time:** 4:10‚Äì5:00 PM (50 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Honor the learning journey, create closure, celebrate commitment

### 4:10-4:15 ‚Äî TRANSITION TO CEREMONY SPACE (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"We're going to shift now into our closing ceremony. This is a time to honor what you've learned, acknowledge the courage it took to show up, and set an intention for the work ahead.

Let's rearrange the space into a circle. Everyone bring your chair and form a circle‚Äîno tables, just us."

**[RESET SPACE - Circle seating, optional: candle or meaningful object in center]**

### 4:15-4:35 ‚Äî REFLECTION & INTEGRATION (20 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Three days ago, you walked into this room with questions, curiosity, maybe some nervousness. You've spent the last three days learning about addiction, family systems, the Intervention Continuum, ethics, and practice.

Before we close, I want to create space for you to reflect on this journey."

**[ACTIVITY - Silent Reflection: 5 minutes]**

"Take out your journal or just sit quietly. Reflect on these questions:
1. What did you learn that surprised you?
2. What are you most proud of from these three days?
3. What are you taking with you into the work ahead?

Five minutes of silence. Just be with your thoughts."

**[SHARING CIRCLE - 15 minutes]**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Now we'll go around the circle. Each person will have a minute or two to share:
- One thing you're taking with you from this training.
- One commitment you're making to yourself and the families you'll serve.

I'll start, and we'll go clockwise."

**[FACILITATOR MODELS FIRST]**

Example:
*"What I'm taking with me is the reminder that love is the container for all of this work. It's easy to get caught up in tools and techniques, but if I forget the love, I've lost the plot. My commitment is to pause before every intervention and ask myself, 'Am I doing this in love?' If the answer is no, I won't proceed."*

**[GO AROUND CIRCLE - Allow 1-2 minutes per person]**

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Listen deeply, affirm each person
- Notice themes and name them at the end
- Tissue box ready (emotions often surface here)
- This is sacred time‚Äîprotect it from rushing

### 4:35-4:50 ‚Äî CERTIFICATE PRESENTATION & RECOGNITION (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"You have completed the Core Values Interventionist Training‚Äî3 days of intensive learning, practice, and growth. This is no small thing.

I want to honor each of you by name as I present your certificate. When I call your name, please come forward."

**[CALL EACH NAME - Present certificate individually]**

**Template for each person:**
*"[Name], for your commitment to serving families with dignity, compassion, and skill, I present you with this certificate. May it remind you of what you've learned and the lives you'll touch. Thank you for being here."*

**[OPTIONAL: Group photo with certificates]**

### 4:50-5:00 ‚Äî FINAL WORDS & BLESSING (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing]**

"Before we part ways, I want to leave you with this:

Intervention work is sacred. You are walking into the most painful, terrifying moments of a family's life and saying, *'I see you. I'm here. There is hope.'*

That is holy work.

You will not do it perfectly. You will make mistakes. You will have interventions that don't go the way you planned. You will feel inadequate sometimes.

But you are *enough*. You have been trained. You have the framework. You have the heart. And you have a community of mentors and peers who will walk with you.

Go forward with courage, compassion, and care. Trust that the families who need you will find you. And when they do, show up fully.

The world needs you. The families drowning in addiction need you. The Pivot Persons who have lost hope need you.

Thank you for saying yes to this work. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for being here."

**[PAUSE]**

**[OPTIONAL CLOSING RITUAL]**

**Option 1: Breath & Release**
"Let's take one final breath together. [INHALE] Breathe in courage. [EXHALE] Release fear. You are ready."

**Option 2: Hands in Circle**
"Everyone stand and join hands in the circle. Feel the connection‚Äîthis is your community. You are not alone in this work. Squeeze the hand of the person next to you, and pass it around the circle. When it comes back to me, we're complete."

**[FINAL WORDS]**

"Go in peace. Go with courage. Go with love. And I'll see you in the mentorship program. You're dismissed."
