## SESSION 2.1: MORNING CHECK-IN & INTEGRATION
**‚è∞ Time:** 9:00‚Äì9:30 AM (30 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Ground the group, integrate Day 1 learning, prepare for Day 2 depth

### 9:00-9:10 ‚Äî WELCOME & CENTERING (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to Day 2. Yesterday we built our foundation‚Äîawareness of what intervention is, how addiction operates systemically, and the language we use to create dignity and connection.

Today, we move into *Coordination*‚Äîthe architecture of care. We're going to explore the practical questions: Who does what? How do we assess which intervention mode fits this family? What tools do we use? And we'll begin applying these frameworks to real family scenarios.

Before we dive in, let's take a moment to ground ourselves."

**[PAUSE - 30 seconds of silence or optional breath work]**

"As we enter Day 2, I invite you to bring your full presence to this work. The families you'll serve are waiting for you to show up with skill, compassion, and courage. Let's be here for them‚Äîand for each other."

### 9:10-9:25 ‚Äî INTEGRATION CIRCLE (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Invitation]**

"Let's do a quick go-around. In one or two sentences, share:
1. One insight from Day 1 that stayed with you overnight.
2. One question you're bringing into Day 2.

We'll move quickly‚Äîthis is just a pulse check, not deep discussion. Who'd like to start?"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Listen for themes: language shifts, systems thinking, personal connections
- Track questions‚Äîsome may be addressed directly in Day 2 content
- Note any unresolved concerns for parking lot or 1:1 follow-up
- Keep energy high and pace brisk (60-90 seconds per person max)

### 9:25-9:30 ‚Äî DAY 2 ROADMAP (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Orientation]**

"Thank you. I heard themes around [name 1-2 themes]. Many of your questions will be addressed today, especially around [reference common question themes].

Here's our roadmap for Day 2:

**Morning:**
- **Roles & Boundaries** ‚Äî Who does what in intervention work
- **Intervention Continuum** ‚Äî Our core framework: 5 modes from collaborative to crisis

**Afternoon:**
- **Tools of Intervention** ‚Äî Impact Letters, scripts, logistics planning
- **Case Study Setup** ‚Äî You'll be assigned family scenarios to work with through Day 3

By the end of today, you'll have a clear framework for *how* to design and facilitate interventions across the full spectrum of family readiness and crisis. Let's get started."

---

## SESSION 2.2: ROLES & BOUNDARIES IN INTERVENTION WORK
**‚è∞ Time:** 9:30‚Äì11:00 AM (90 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Clarify the interventionist's role, establish boundaries, define team member responsibilities

### 9:30-9:45 ‚Äî THE INTERVENTIONIST'S ROLE (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Let's start with a fundamental question: *What is the interventionist's role?*

In the Core Values model, the interventionist is **a guide, not a guru**. You are not:
- The family therapist (though you may refer them to one)
- The treatment center (though you help them access one)
- The person who 'fixes' the Pivot Person
- The hero who swoops in with all the answers

You ARE:
- **A skilled facilitator** who creates safe space for hard conversations
- **An educator** who helps families understand addiction and recovery
- **A coordinator** who organizes the team and process
- **A compassionate witness** who holds hope when the family can't

Let me share a metaphor that helps: Think of yourself as a **sherpa on a mountain climb**. You know the terrain, you've been up this mountain before, you have the skills and tools. But the family is doing the climbing. Your job is to guide them safely, point out hazards, suggest paths, and carry some of the load‚Äîbut ultimately, *they* take each step."

**[ACTIVITY - Pair & Share: 5 minutes]**

"Turn to the person next to you. Share one thing you think will be *hardest* about staying in the 'guide' role and not slipping into 'guru' or 'hero' mode. What boundary do you think you'll struggle with?"

**[DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

"What came up in your conversations?"

**Listen for:** Desire to rescue, pressure to have answers, boundary violations, personal trauma triggers

### 9:45-10:15 ‚Äî TEAM ROLES & DYNAMICS (30 minutes)

**[FLIP CHART - Write as you teach]**

**Key Roles in an Intervention Team:**

**1. The Intervention Specialist (You)**
- Designs the process based on assessment
- Facilitates the intervention meeting (if applicable)
- Provides education and support to family
- Coordinates logistics and follow-through

**2. The Concerned Persons (Family/Friends/Network)**
- Share their lived experience and love
- Participate in preparation process
- May write Impact Letters
- Support follow-through and recovery

**3. The Pivot Person**
- The individual being invited into treatment/change
- Not always present in planning (depends on mode)
- Always treated with dignity and respect
- Ultimate decision-maker about their own recovery

**4. Allied Professionals (as needed)**
- Therapist, physician, spiritual advisor, employer
- Provide specialized support or leverage
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Coordinate with interventionist

**5. Treatment/Recovery Resources**
- Treatment center, sober living, outpatient program
- Should be pre-arranged before intervention
- Provide continuity of care
- Often participate in intervention process

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Notice that the interventionist is ONE voice among many. This is a *team effort*. The family owns the outcome. You own the *process*‚Äîthe how, the when, the structure. But the family owns the *relationship* with the Pivot Person.

This distinction is crucial for healthy boundaries."

**[ACTIVITY - Case Example Discussion: 15 minutes]**

**Scenario:** *"A mother calls you and says, 'My son won't listen to me anymore. Will you come to my house and tell him he needs to go to treatment?' How do you respond?"*

**Small Group Discussion (5 minutes):** "In groups of 3-4, discuss: What's the boundary issue here? How would you redirect this mother while still honoring her pain?"

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 10 minutes]**

**Key Teaching Points to Surface:**
- Mother wants you to be the authority ‚Üí redirect to collaborative team model
- "Tell him" language ‚Üí invitational language
- Importance of preparation, not just showing up
- Mother's role as primary relationship holder
- Your role as facilitator of *her* message, not replacement of it

### 10:15-10:30 ‚Äî BOUNDARIES & SELF-CARE (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Intervention work is emotionally intense. You will witness suffering, desperation, anger, grief, and‚Äîif you're lucky‚Äîbeautiful moments of breakthrough and connection. To do this work sustainably, you must have clear boundaries and robust self-care.

Here are some non-negotiables:"

**[FLIP CHART - Write as you teach]**

**Core Boundaries:**
1. **Scope of Practice** ‚Äî Stay in your lane (interventionist, not therapist/sponsor/friend)
2. **Confidentiality** ‚Äî Protect family privacy rigorously
3. **Availability** ‚Äî Set clear hours and response times
4. **Dual Relationships** ‚Äî Don't work with friends/family; refer out
5. **Financial Transparency** ‚Äî Clear contracts, no hidden fees
6. **Self-Awareness** ‚Äî Know your triggers and limits

**Self-Care Practices:**
- Peer supervision/consultation
- Your own therapy or recovery support
- Regular breaks and time off
- Physical health (sleep, exercise, nutrition)
- Spiritual practice or grounding rituals
- Creative outlets and joy

**[PAUSE]**

"I want to name something: If you are in your own early recovery (less than 2-3 years), please proceed cautiously with intervention work. This is advanced work that requires emotional stability and established support systems. There's no shame in waiting until you're ready. The families you serve deserve your full, grounded presence."

**[ACTIVITY - Personal Reflection: 5 minutes]**

"Take a moment in your workbook. Write down:
1. One boundary you know you need to establish in this work.
2. One self-care practice you commit to maintaining.

You don't have to share these‚Äîthey're for you."

### 10:30-10:45 ‚Äî BREAK (15 minutes)

**Facilitator Task During Break:**
- Set up for Session 2.3 (Intervention Continuum Module)
- Distribute printed Mode Selector Assessment Tools
- Prepare case scenario cards for practice

### 10:45-11:00 ‚Äî ETHICS IN ACTION (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Before we move into the Intervention Continuum, I want to ground us in ethics. Yesterday we talked about the four core questions:"

**[FLIP CHART - Refer back to Day 1]**

**The Four Ethical Questions:**
1. Is this being done in love?
2. Does this preserve the Pivot Person's dignity?
3. Is this in the family's best interest, or someone else's agenda?
4. Are there any financial conflicts of interest?

**[NEW TEACHING]**

"As we explore different intervention modes today‚Äîfrom gentle, collaborative invitations all the way to crisis interventions‚Äîyou might feel uncomfortable with some of the more structured or surprise-based approaches. That's okay. That discomfort is worth exploring.

Here's the key: **Ethics are not the same as comfort.**

Some interventions are *uncomfortable* but deeply ethical‚Äîlike when we interrupt enabling patterns or set firm boundaries to protect safety. Other interventions might *feel* loving but are actually harmful‚Äîlike endless rescuing that prevents consequences.

The question is never, 'Does this feel easy?' The question is, 'Does this serve the Pivot Person's best chance at life and dignity?'

Hold that as we go into the Continuum."

**[TRANSITION]**

"Okay. We're ready for the heart of Day 2‚Äîthe Intervention Continuum. This is the framework that will guide all your intervention work. Let's dive in."

## SESSION 2.3: INTERVENTION CONTINUUM MODULE (INTEGRATED)
**‚è∞ Time:** 11:00 AM‚Äì1:00 PM (120 minutes, including working lunch)
**üéØ Purpose:** Master the 5-mode Intervention Continuum and assessment framework

**üìñ Reference:** This session integrates the full [Intervention_Continuum_Module.md](Intervention_Continuum_Module.md)

### 11:00-11:05 ‚Äî MODULE INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Introduction]**

"We're now entering the core of this training: The Intervention Continuum.

This is the innovation that makes Core Values intervention work so versatile and effective. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, we've created a **5-mode spectrum** that allows you to meet families exactly where they are‚Äîand design interventions that match their unique situation.

Over the next two hours, we'll explore:
- The 5 modes from most collaborative to most urgent
- How to assess which mode fits which family
- The research behind each approach
- Practice scenarios for each mode

This is detailed content, so we're going to take our time. We'll break midway through for a working lunch, and you'll have materials to reference long after this training."

**[DISTRIBUTE]**
- Intervention Continuum handout (condensed version)
- Mode Selector Assessment Tool
- Blank note-taking pages

### 11:05-12:00 ‚Äî MODES 1-3: INVITATIONAL SPECTRUM (55 minutes)

**[Follow Intervention_Continuum_Module.md content, Section: "The 5-Mode Spectrum"]**

**Teaching Sequence:**

**MODE 1: COLLABORATIVE INVITATION (15 minutes)**
- Definition & research basis (ARISE, CRAFT)
- When to use (Contemplation stage, strong relationships, no crisis)
- How it works (family meetings over weeks, progressive engagement)
- Example: Martinez family scenario
- Practice: Identify Mode 1 indicators in a brief case vignette

**MODE 2: STRUCTURED INVITATION (20 minutes)**
- Definition & research basis (Modified Johnson Model, LoveFirst)
- When to use (Precontemplation, moderate urgency, functional Pivot Person)
- How it works (prepared team, rehearsed messages, same-day treatment)
- Core Values distinction: dignity over confrontation
- Example: Thompson family scenario
- Practice: Write one Impact Letter opening line

**MODE 3: PLANNED SURPRISE (20 minutes)**
- Definition & research basis (Traditional Johnson with modifications)
- When to use (high denial, safety concerns, relationship strain)
- Ethical considerations: dignity in structure
- How it works (confidential planning, surprise meeting, immediate transport)
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Example: Brief case vignette
- Group Discussion: When is surprise ethical?

### 12:00-12:30 ‚Äî WORKING LUNCH (30 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Transition]**

"Let's pause here and take a working lunch. We'll break for 30 minutes. Lunch is available [location].

While you eat, I invite you to:
1. Review the Mode Selector Assessment Tool handout
2. Reflect on this question: *Which mode feels most aligned with your natural style? Which mode makes you most uncomfortable, and why?*
3. Chat with your neighbors about what you're learning

We'll reconvene at 12:30 to cover Modes 4 and 5, then practice assessment."

**Facilitator Tasks During Lunch:**
- Check in with any participants who seem confused or overwhelmed
- Prepare Mode 4 & 5 teaching materials
- Set up practice scenario stations

### 12:30-12:55 ‚Äî MODES 4-5: CRISIS SPECTRUM (25 minutes)

**[Resume teaching from Intervention_Continuum_Module.md]**

**MODE 4: AD-HOC CRISIS INTERVENTION (12 minutes)**
- Definition: Unplanned intervention in response to acute crisis
- When to use (overdose, arrest, ER visit, suicide attempt)
- How it works (rapid assessment, meet family at crisis point, leverage urgency)
- Example: Chen family scenario (ER psychiatric hold)
- Key skill: Flexibility and trauma-informed response
- Practice: Role-play a phone call from a family in crisis

**MODE 5: INDIVIDUAL INTERVENTION (13 minutes)**
- Definition: One-on-one conversation without family involvement
- When to use (family cutoff, Pivot Person requests help, no support system)
- How it works (therapeutic relationship building, harm reduction, gradual engagement)
- Ethical note: Informed consent is paramount
- Example: Individual reaches out after relapse
- Discussion: How does this differ from coaching or therapy?

### 12:55-1:00 PM ‚Äî CONTINUUM SUMMARY & VISUAL MAP (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Synthesis]**

"Let's pause and see the full picture."

**[DISPLAY VISUAL: The Intervention Continuum]**

```
MODE 1          MODE 2           MODE 3           MODE 4         MODE 5
Collaborative   Structured       Planned         Ad-Hoc         Individual
Invitation      Invitation       Surprise        Crisis         Intervention

INVITATIONAL ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí URGENT/CRISIS
```

"Notice: This is not a hierarchy of 'better' or 'worse.' It's a spectrum of *what fits this family right now.*

Your job as an interventionist is to:
1. **Assess** accurately using the three factors (safety, readiness, relational capacity)
2. **Recommend** the mode that best serves the Pivot Person and family
3. **Educate** the family about why you're recommending this approach
4. **Execute** with skill, compassion, and flexibility

Sometimes you'll start in Mode 1 and escalate to Mode 3 if the situation changes. Sometimes a crisis (Mode 4) becomes the doorway to ongoing collaborative support (Mode 1). Stay flexible. Let the assessment guide you."

**[TRANSITION]**

"Now let's practice assessment. This is where theory becomes skill."

---

## SESSION 2.4: TOOLS OF INTERVENTION
**‚è∞ Time:** 1:30‚Äì3:00 PM (90 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Equip participants with practical tools (Impact Letters, scripts, logistics planning)

### 1:30-1:35 ‚Äî SESSION INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Orientation]**

"Welcome back. This afternoon we shift from framework to *tools*‚Äîthe practical, tangible things you'll use in intervention work.

We'll cover three major tool categories:
1. **Impact Letters** ‚Äî The heart of many interventions
2. **Facilitation Scripts** ‚Äî Language for guiding meetings
3. **Logistics Planning** ‚Äî The behind-the-scenes coordination

By the end of this session, you'll have templates, examples, and practice using each tool. Let's start with Impact Letters."

### 1:35-2:15 ‚Äî IMPACT LETTERS (40 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Impact Letters are one of the most powerful tools in intervention work. They are written messages from Concerned Persons to the Pivot Person, read aloud during a structured intervention (Modes 2 or 3 primarily).

But here's what they are NOT:
- ‚ùå A list of grievances or complaints
- ‚ùå A guilt trip or shame session
- ‚ùå An ultimatum or threat
- ‚ùå A venting session for the writer

They ARE:
- ‚úÖ A loving, honest expression of concern
- ‚úÖ Specific examples of impact (behavior ‚Üí consequence)
- ‚úÖ An invitation to accept help
- ‚úÖ A statement of commitment to support recovery"

**[STRUCTURE OF AN IMPACT LETTER]**

**[FLIP CHART - Write structure as you teach]**

**1. Opening: Love & Connection (1-2 sentences)**
- "I love you and I'm writing this because I care deeply about you."
- Example: *"Sarah, you are my daughter and I love you more than words can say. I'm writing this letter because I want you to know how much you matter to me and our family."*

**2. Specific Observations: What I've Seen (3-5 examples)**
- Focus on *behavior* and *impact*, not character attacks
- Use "I" statements: "I felt scared when..." not "You're irresponsible"
- Be concrete: dates, events, specific incidents
- Example: *"Last Tuesday when you didn't come home until 3 AM, I stayed awake all night terrified that something had happened to you. I felt helpless and afraid."*

**3. Impact on Me/Us: How This Affects Our Relationship (2-3 sentences)**
- Honest emotional impact
- Connection to family values or shared history
- Example: *"I miss the daughter who used to call me every Sunday. I miss laughing with you. I feel like I'm losing you, and it breaks my heart."*

**4. The Ask: Invitation to Treatment (1-2 sentences)**
- Clear, specific request
- Frame as opportunity, not punishment
- Example: *"Today we're asking you to accept help. We've arranged a place for you at [Treatment Center] where you can get the support you need and deserve."*

**5. Closing: Hope & Commitment (1-2 sentences)**
- Reaffirm love and support
- Express hope for the future
- Example: *"I believe in you, Sarah. I know recovery is possible, and I'll be here every step of the way. I love you."*

**[EXAMPLE - Read aloud or display]**

**Sample Impact Letter:**

*"Maria,*

*I'm your sister, and I love you. I'm writing this because you mean the world to me, and I'm scared I'm going to lose you.*

*Three weeks ago, you missed Sophie's birthday party‚Äîthe one she'd been talking about for months. When I called, you said you'd just forgotten. But I could tell from your voice that something was wrong. Sophie cried that night asking where her Aunt Maria was.*

*Last month, you borrowed $200 for 'rent,' but I later found out you'd been evicted weeks earlier. I felt betrayed and worried, not because of the money, but because I realized you felt you had to lie to me.*

*I miss my sister. I miss our Saturday morning coffee dates, the way we used to laugh until we cried, the way you always knew exactly what to say when I was struggling. I feel like addiction is stealing you from me, from Sophie, from all of us who love you.*

*Today we're asking you to go to treatment. We've found a place that can help you‚Äîa place where you can rest, heal, and find your way back to yourself. We're ready to drive you there right now.*

*I believe in you, Maria. I know the strong, brilliant, loving woman you are is still in there. And I promise I'll be here, walking alongside you, every single day. I love you.*

*‚ÄîYour sister, Carmen"*

**[DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

"What do you notice about this letter? What makes it effective?"

**Listen for:** Specificity, love + truth, invitation not ultimatum, hope

**[ACTIVITY - Impact Letter Practice: 20 minutes]**

**Instructions:**
"You're going to practice writing an Impact Letter opening and one specific example. Use this prompt:

*Imagine you're writing to a close friend or family member (real or fictional) who is struggling with addiction. Write:*
1. Your opening (love & connection)
2. One specific observation (behavior + impact)

You have 10 minutes to write. Then we'll share a few examples."

**[SILENT WRITING - 10 minutes]**

**[SHARING - 10 minutes]**

"Would anyone like to share what they wrote? Remember, this is practice‚Äîit doesn't have to be perfect."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Invite 3-4 volunteers to read aloud
- Offer gentle feedback: affirm what's working, suggest refinements
- Common issues: vagueness, blame language, lack of "I" statements
- Normalize difficulty: "This is hard work. It takes practice."

### 2:15-2:35 ‚Äî FACILITATION SCRIPTS & MEETING STRUCTURE (20 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Impact Letters are what the family says. Now let's talk about what *you* say‚Äîthe facilitation language that guides the intervention meeting.

Your role as facilitator is to:
- Set the tone (calm, loving, focused)
- Explain the process
- Manage time and order of speakers
- Redirect if things get off track
- Invite the Pivot Person to respond
- Present the treatment option

You are the *container* that holds the process."

**[SAMPLE OPENING SCRIPT - Mode 2 Structured Invitation]**

**[Read aloud or display]**

*"[Pivot Person's name], thank you for being here. I know this might feel surprising or even uncomfortable, and I want you to know that everyone in this room is here because they love you.*

*My name is [your name], and I'm an intervention specialist. I've been working with your family over the past [timeframe] to prepare for this conversation. This is not an attack or an ambush‚Äîthis is an invitation.*

*We're going to spend the next [30-45 minutes] sharing with you how your substance use has impacted the people who care about you most. Each person has written you a letter, and they're going to read it to you. Your job is just to listen. You don't have to respond or defend yourself‚Äîjust receive what they're offering you, which is their truth and their love.*

*After everyone has shared, we'll talk about a treatment option that we believe can help you. And then you'll have a choice to make.*

*Does that make sense? Do you have any questions before we begin?"*

**[DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

"What do you notice about this script?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Calm, clear, non-threatening tone
- Transparency about process
- Framing as "invitation" not intervention
- Clear role definition (listen, not defend)
- Choice is honored

**[ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS - Provide handouts]**

Provide printed scripts for:
- Redirecting defensive behavior: *"I hear that you're feeling [emotion]. Let's take a breath and keep listening."*
- Transitioning to treatment presentation: *"Thank you all for sharing. [Pivot Person], you've just heard from people who love you. Now let me tell you about an opportunity..."*
- Handling refusal: *"I understand this feels like a lot. What questions do you have? What feels hardest about saying yes?"*

### 2:35-3:00 ‚Äî LOGISTICS PLANNING (25 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Teaching]**

"Intervention is 80% preparation, 20% the meeting itself. Let's talk logistics‚Äîthe coordination work that happens behind the scenes.

Here's what you need to plan:"

**[FLIP CHART - Write as you teach]**

**[ACTIVITY - Logistics Scenario Planning: 15 minutes]**

**Small Groups (3-4 people):**

"You're planning a Mode 2 Structured Invitation for a 35-year-old woman with alcohol use disorder. She's high-functioning, works full-time, has two young kids, and is in deep denial. Her husband, mother, and best friend are on the team.

In your groups, create a logistics timeline:
- What needs to happen in what order?
- What are potential obstacles?
- What's your Plan B if she refuses?

You have 10 minutes. Use the handout template."

**[FULL GROUP DEBRIEF - 5 minutes]**

"Let's hear from one or two groups. What did you come up with?"

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Childcare logistics (critical for parents)
- Work leave coordination (FMLA, PTO)
- Financial planning (treatment costs, lost income)
- Plan B is essential (what if she says no?)

**[TRANSITION]**

"You now have a toolkit: Impact Letters, scripts, logistics planning. In our next session, you're going to apply all of this‚Äîplus the Intervention Continuum‚Äîto real family scenarios. This is where it gets real."

---

## SESSION 2.5: FAMILY CASE STUDY SETUP
**‚è∞ Time:** 3:15‚Äì4:30 PM (75 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Assign case studies and begin intervention planning in small groups

### 3:15-3:20 ‚Äî SESSION INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Introduction]**

"We're moving from learning to *application*. For the rest of today and all of tomorrow, you'll work in small groups on family case studies.

You'll be assigned one of three families:
1. **Martinez Family** (Mode 1 - Collaborative Invitation)
2. **Thompson Family** (Mode 2 - Structured Invitation)
3. **Chen Family** (Mode 4 - Ad-Hoc Crisis Intervention)

Each case includes full role cards with character backgrounds, family dynamics, and intervention challenges. Your group's job is to:
- Assess the family using the Mode Selector
- Plan an intervention strategy

## SESSION 2.6: DAY 2 REFLECTION & CLOSING
**‚è∞ Time:** 4:30‚Äì5:00 PM (30 minutes)
**üéØ Purpose:** Integrate learning, name insights, prepare for Day 3

### 4:30-4:40 ‚Äî INTEGRATION PAIRS (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Invitation]**

"We've covered a lot today‚Äîroles, boundaries, the 5-mode Intervention Continuum, tools, and case studies. Let's take a few minutes to integrate before we go.

Find a partner‚Äîsomeone you haven't worked with much today. Take turns sharing:
1. One thing you learned today that shifted your thinking.
2. One thing you're nervous or curious about for tomorrow's role-plays.

5 minutes each. Go."

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Observe energy levels (are people tired, energized, overwhelmed?)
- Listen for themes to address in Day 3 opening
- Note any participants who seem particularly anxious about role-plays

### 4:40-4:55 ‚Äî FULL GROUP REFLECTION CIRCLE (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Invitation]**

"Let's come back together. I'd love to hear from a few of you‚Äîwhat's landing? What's still percolating?

We'll go popcorn style‚Äîjust speak up if you feel moved to share. No pressure."

**Listen for themes:**
- Complexity of assessment (Continuum can feel overwhelming at first)
- Discomfort with surprise-based modes (Mode 3)
- Excitement about having a flexible framework
- Personal resonance with case studies
- Questions about boundaries and self-care

**[FACILITATOR REFLECTION - 5 minutes]**

"Here's what I heard: [Name 2-3 themes].

I want to name that the Intervention Continuum *is* complex. That's by design. Families are complex. Addiction is complex. There's no cookie-cutter formula. But what you *do* have now is a map‚Äîa way to orient yourself and make intentional decisions.

Tomorrow, you'll practice using that map in real time. You'll make mistakes in your role-plays. That's the point. Better to stumble here, with supportive peers, than with a real family in crisis.

I'm really proud of the work you did today. You showed up, you engaged, you asked hard questions. That's exactly what this work requires."

### 4:55-5:00 ‚Äî CLOSING & PREVIEW OF DAY 3 (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing]**

"Here's what tomorrow looks like:

**Day 3: CARE**
- Morning: Case study planning and rehearsal
- Midday: Full role-play simulations (you'll run your interventions)
- Afternoon: Debrief, ethics deep dive, and closing ceremony

Come ready to play full out. The role-plays are where the learning really happens.

Before we go, let's close with a simple grounding practice."

**[CLOSING RITUAL - 2 minutes]**

**Option 1: Breath & Intention**
"Close your eyes if that feels comfortable. Take three deep breaths. [PAUSE] On your next inhale, breathe in courage for tomorrow. On your exhale, release any pressure to be perfect. [PAUSE] Thank you for being here. See you in the morning."

**Option 2: Circle of Gratitude**
"Let's stand in a circle. If you're willing, place your hand on your heart. Think of one thing you're grateful for from today‚Äîsomething you learned, someone you connected with, a moment of insight. [PAUSE] Hold that gratitude as we close. Thank you. See you tomorrow."

**[DISMISSAL]**

"You're free to go. If you have questions or need anything, I'll be here for a few more minutes. Otherwise, have a great evening and see you at 9:00 AM sharp."
