# 1. ETHICS CODE FOR CORE VALUES INTERVENTIONISTS

## Preamble

As a Core Values Interventionist, you commit to the highest standards of ethical practice in service to families and individuals affected by addiction. This Ethics Code guides your professional conduct and grounds your work in dignity, compassion, and integrity.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

### PRINCIPLE 1: Love as Foundation
**All intervention work must be rooted in love, not control, punishment, or financial gain.**

**Practical Application:**
- Before accepting any case, ask: "Is this family approaching the Pivot Person with love or with anger and desperation?"
- If the motivation is punitive, educate the family about reframing, or decline the case
- Regularly check your own motivations: Are you serving the family's best interest or your own need to "save" someone?

---

### PRINCIPLE 2: Dignity Always
**The Pivot Person's humanity and autonomy are never negotiable.**

**Practical Application:**
- Use person-first, dignity-centered language in all communication
- Never coerce, manipulate, or deceive the Pivot Person beyond what is ethically justified (Mode 3 surprise interventions must still preserve dignity)
- Honor the Pivot Person's ultimate right to refuse treatment, even when it's heartbreaking
- Ensure all family members understand: We invite, we don't force

---

### PRINCIPLE 3: Family-Centered Process
**The family owns the relationship; the interventionist owns the process.**

**Practical Application:**
- You are a guide, not the hero or the authority figure
- The family's voice carries more weight than yours‚Äîempower them to speak, don't replace their voices
- Respect cultural, religious, and familial values even when they differ from your own
- Step back when the family is ready to take ownership; don't create dependency

---

### PRINCIPLE 4: Transparency & Honesty
**No hidden agendas, financial conflicts, or manipulation.**

**Practical Application:**
- Disclose all financial arrangements clearly and upfront (fees, treatment center relationships, referral arrangements)
- Never accept kickbacks, bonuses, or incentives from treatment centers that could bias your recommendation
- Be honest about success rates, risks, and limitations of intervention
- If you don't know something, say so‚Äîdon't pretend to have expertise you lack

---

### PRINCIPLE 5: Do No Harm
**If an intervention could make things worse, don't do it.**

**Practical Application:**
- Conduct thorough safety and readiness assessments before recommending an intervention mode
- Decline cases where safety risks (violence, suicidality, severe mental illness) are beyond your scope
- Err on the side of caution: It's better to wait or refer out than to cause trauma
- Prioritize Pivot Person's safety, family's safety, and your own safety‚Äîalways

---

### PRINCIPLE 6: Cultural Humility
**Respect and honor the family's cultural context, values, and lived experience.**

**Practical Application:**
- Learn about the cultural norms, beliefs, and communication styles of the families you serve
- Don't impose Western, white, middle-class assumptions about "healthy" family dynamics
- Seek consultation or refer out when cultural differences are beyond your competence
- Center the family's wisdom about what will work in *their* context

---

### PRINCIPLE 7: Professional Boundaries
**Stay in your lane; know when to refer out.**

**Practical Application:**
- You are an interventionist, not a therapist, sponsor, or long-term case manager
- Refer families to appropriate resources (therapy, legal support, financial counseling) when needs exceed your scope
- Avoid dual relationships (don't work with friends, family, sponsees, or people you have other relationships with)
- Maintain clear professional boundaries around time, availability, and emotional involvement

---

### PRINCIPLE 8: Ongoing Competence
**Commit to continuous learning, supervision, and self-reflection.**

**Practical Application:**
- Participate in peer consultation and supervision regularly
- Pursue continuing education in addiction, trauma, family systems, and ethics
- Seek feedback on your work and be willing to grow from mistakes
- Maintain your own mental health, recovery (if applicable), and self-care practices

---

## The Four Ethical Questions (Applied)

Before every intervention, ask yourself:

### 1. Is this being done in love?
- What is the family's motivation? Fear, anger, control, or genuine love and concern?
- Am I approaching this work from a place of compassion or ego?

### 2. Does this preserve the Pivot Person's dignity?
- Will this intervention honor their humanity, or will it shame and degrade them?
- Are we using language and processes that invite rather than attack?

### 3. Is this in the family's best interest, or someone else's agenda?
- Who really wants this intervention‚Äîthe family, or an outside party (employer, court, treatment center)?
- Are there power dynamics or hidden motivations at play?

### 4. Are there any financial conflicts of interest?
- Am I benefiting financially from a specific treatment placement?
- Have I disclosed all financial relationships to the family?
- Is my judgment compromised by money?

**If you cannot answer YES to questions 1, 2, and 3, and NO to question 4, do not proceed with the intervention.**

---

## Ethical Violations & Consequences

**Examples of Ethical Violations:**
- Accepting kickbacks from treatment centers
- Coercing or forcing a Pivot Person against their will outside the bounds of Mode 3 surprise interventions
- Working with families or Pivot Persons you have personal relationships with
- Failing to assess for safety risks and proceeding with a dangerous intervention
- Lying to or manipulating the Pivot Person in ways that violate dignity
- Practicing outside your scope of competence without supervision or referral

**Consequences:**
- Loss of Core Values Interventionist certification
- Removal from professional network and referral sources
- Potential legal liability for harm caused

**Reporting Mechanism:**
- If you witness or suspect ethical violations by another Core Values Interventionist, report to [Ethics Committee contact]
- All reports are confidential and investigated thoroughly

---

# 2. COMPLETE LANGUAGE REFERENCE GUIDE

## Core Values Language Framework

Language shapes reality. The words we use in intervention work affect how Pivot Persons see themselves, how families understand addiction, and whether people feel invited or shamed.

---

## SAY THIS ‚Üí NOT THAT

| ‚úÖ **SAY THIS** | ‚ùå **NOT THAT** | **WHY** |
|---|---|---|
| **Pivot Person** | Addict, alcoholic, junkie, user | "Pivot Person" emphasizes *agency*‚Äîthis is someone who can pivot toward health. It's not an identity; it's a moment of choice. |
| **Person with a substance use disorder** / **Struggling with addiction** | Drug habit, addiction problem, has a drug problem | Person-first language separates the person from the disorder. They *have* a condition; they are not *defined* by it. |
| **Healthy Choices** | Boundaries | "Boundaries" can feel punitive or controlling. "Healthy Choices" emphasizes the family's agency and self-care. |
| **Concerned Persons** / **Care Team** | Loved ones, family | Not all families are loving, and not all care teams are biological family. "Concerned Persons" is neutral and inclusive. |
| **Treatment** / **Recovery support** | Rehab | "Rehab" is colloquial and stigmatized. "Treatment" is clinical and dignified. |
| **Relapse** | Failure, fell off the wagon, went back out | Relapse is a medical event, not a moral failing. It's a common part of recovery and signals the need for adjusted support. |
| **In recovery** / **In active recovery** | Clean, sober | "Clean" implies the person was "dirty" before. "In recovery" is neutral and ongoing. |
| **Using substances** / **Actively using** | Getting high, partying, being messed up | Focus on the behavior (substance use) not the character judgment (messed up). |
| **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)** / **Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)** | Replacement drugs, still using | Methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone are *treatments*, not "replacement addictions." |
| **Harm reduction** | Enabling | Harm reduction (clean needles, safer use education) *reduces* death and disease. It's evidence-based care, not enabling. |
| **Consequences** | Punishment | Consequences are natural outcomes of behavior. Punishment is inflicted with intent to harm or control. |
| **Recovery is a Team Sport** | The addict needs to want it | Recovery involves the whole system. The Pivot Person doesn't have to "want it" alone; the team holds hope and accountability together. |

---

## Invitational Language Examples

### Instead of: "You need to go to treatment."
**Try:** "We're inviting you to accept help. We've arranged a place where you can get the support you deserve. Will you go today?"

### Instead of: "Your drinking is destroying this family."
**Try:** "When you drink, I feel scared and helpless. I miss the connection we used to have, and I want that back."

### Instead of: "If you don't get help, I'm done with you."
**Try:** "I love you, and I can't keep watching you hurt yourself. I'm choosing to take care of myself by [boundary]. I hope you'll choose treatment so we can heal together."

### Instead of: "You're being selfish and irresponsible."
**Try:** "I see you're in pain, and I believe the substance use is your way of coping. I want to help you find healthier ways to heal."

---

## Pronouns and Person-First Language

### Person-First Language:
- "Person with a substance use disorder" (not "substance abuser")
- "Person in recovery" (not "recovering addict")
- "Person who uses drugs" (not "drug user")

### Why It Matters:
Person-first language reminds us that *people are not their diagnoses*. Addiction is something a person experiences, not who they are.

---

## Language for Different Audiences

### With Families:
- Use accessible, non-clinical language
- Avoid jargon (don't assume they know "enabling," "codependency," "Stages of Change")
- Explain concepts clearly and compassionately

### With Treatment Professionals:
- Clinical language is appropriate ("SUD," "MAT," "comorbidity")
- Be precise and evidence-based in your communication

### With Pivot Persons:
- Mirror their language when appropriate (if they say "I'm an alcoholic" and identify with that, don't correct them)
- Prioritize *their* comfort and agency with language
- Avoid clinical jargon that creates distance

# 3. RESEARCH SUMMARIES & EVIDENCE BASE

## Overview

The Core Values Intervention Continuum is grounded in evidence-based practices from leading intervention methodologies. Here's a summary of the research that informs each mode.

---

## Mode 1: Collaborative Invitation (ARISE, CRAFT)

### ARISE Model (A Relational Intervention Sequence for Engagement)
**Developers:** Dr. Judith Landau, Dr. James Garrett

**Key Research Findings:**
- **83% treatment entry rate** within 3 weeks using the ARISE continuum
- **61% of Pivot Persons enter treatment** after the first Invitation session (before formal intervention)
- Family engagement and systemic approach increase success rates
- Collaborative, non-confrontational approach reduces resistance and shame

**Core Principles:**
- Start with least invasive intervention (phone call, family meeting)
- Escalate only if needed (move from invitation to structured intervention)
- Pivot Person is invited to participate in planning from the beginning

**Source:** Landau, J., & Garrett, J. (2008). "Invitational Intervention: The ARISE Model for engaging reluctant alcohol and drug dependent individuals in treatment." *Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly*, 26(1-2), 147-168.

---

### CRAFT Model (Community Reinforcement and Family Training)
**Developers:** Dr. Robert Meyers, Dr. Jane Ellen Smith

**Key Research Findings:**
- **70% treatment engagement rate** for Pivot Persons whose families used CRAFT
- Reduces family members' depression and anxiety even if Pivot Person doesn't enter treatment
- Non-confrontational, positive reinforcement approach more effective than traditional interventions (Johnson Model)

**Core Principles:**
- Train family members to reinforce sober behavior and allow natural consequences for using behavior
- Improve family communication and reduce enabling
- Focus on family well-being, not just Pivot Person's recovery

**Source:** Meyers, R. J., Miller, W. R., Hill, D. E., & Tonigan, J. S. (1998). "Community reinforcement and family training (CRAFT): Engaging unmotivated drug users in treatment." *Journal of Substance Abuse*, 10(3), 291-308.

---

## Mode 2: Structured Invitation (Modified Johnson Model, LoveFirst)

### Johnson Model (Modified)
**Developer:** Dr. Vernon Johnson (1960s-1980s)

**Traditional Model:**
- Surprise intervention with rehearsed confrontation
- Family reads prepared statements about impact of addiction
- Immediate treatment entry or consequences

**Core Values Modification:**
- Maintains structure and preparation but removes confrontational tone
- Emphasizes love and dignity over "breaking down denial"
- Invites Pivot Person rather than ambushing them (when appropriate)

**Key Research:**
- Original Johnson Model studies showed **60-80% treatment entry** rates
- Criticism: High relapse rates, potential for trauma and family rupture
- Modern adaptations (like Core Values approach) preserve structure while centering compassion

---

### LoveFirst Model
**Developers:** Jeff Jay, Debra Jay

**Key Principles:**
- "Loving confrontation" ‚Äî firm but compassionate
- Focus on team unity and shared message of love
- Structured preparation with Impact Letters and rehearsals
- Emphasis on grace, not guilt

**Approach:**
- Highly structured, often surprise-based
- Family presents unified front
- Treatment plan arranged in advance

**Source:** Jay, J., & Jay, D. (2008). *Love First: A Family's Guide to Intervention*. Hazelden Publishing.

---

## Mode 3: Planned Surprise (Modified Johnson with Core Values Dignity)

**Ethical Framework:**
- Surprise interventions can be appropriate when:
  - Safety/urgency is high
  - Pivot Person is in deep denial or Precontemplation
  - Previous collaborative attempts have failed
  - Family has relational capacity to hold love despite surprise

**Core Values Modifications:**
- Maintain dignity even in surprise context
- Avoid shaming, blaming, or attacking language
- Allow Pivot Person to leave if they choose (no physical restraint)
- Debrief with family regardless of outcome

**Research Caution:**
- Limited research on effectiveness of surprise interventions specifically
- Anecdotal evidence suggests higher short-term success but also higher trauma risk
- Use sparingly and with rigorous ethical assessment

---

## Mode 4: Ad-Hoc Crisis Intervention

**Crisis Intervention Theory:**
- People are most open to change during moments of crisis (arrest, overdose, medical emergency, loss)
- "Leverage the crisis" ‚Äî use urgency to create momentum toward treatment
- Requires flexibility, rapid assessment, and trauma-informed response

**Research Base:**
- Emergency department interventions show **moderate success** in linking people to treatment (30-50% depending on study)
- Motivational Interviewing in crisis settings increases treatment entry
- Key factor: *timing* ‚Äî intervening within 24-72 hours of crisis is critical

**Source:** Academic ED SBIRT Research Collaborative. (2007). "The impact of screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment on emergency department patients' alcohol use." *Annals of Emergency Medicine*, 50(6), 699-710.

---

## Mode 5: Individual Intervention (Motivational Interviewing, Harm Reduction)

### Motivational Interviewing (MI)
**Developers:** Dr. William Miller, Dr. Stephen Rollnick

**Key Research Findings:**
- **Moderate to strong effect sizes** for increasing treatment engagement and reducing substance use
- Patient-centered, non-confrontational approach more effective than directive advice-giving
- Particularly effective with people in Precontemplation or Contemplation stages

**Core Principles (OARS):**
- **O**pen-ended questions
- **A**ffirmations
- **R**eflective listening
- **S**ummaries

**Source:** Miller, W. R., & Rollnick, S. (2012). *Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change* (3rd ed.). Guilford Press.

---

### Harm Reduction
**Philosophy:** Meet people where they are; reduce harm even if abstinence isn't immediate goal

**Evidence:**
- Needle exchange programs reduce HIV/Hepatitis C transmission by **30-50%**
- Safe consumption sites reduce overdose deaths and connect people to treatment
- Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) reduces opioid overdose deaths by **50%+**

**Application to Mode 5:**
- Individual interventions may start with harm reduction goals (reduce use, use more safely) before moving to abstinence
- Builds trust and relationship, which increases long-term treatment engagement

---

## Stages of Change (Transtheoretical Model)

**Developers:** Dr. James Prochaska, Dr. Carlo DiClemente

**Stages:**
1. **Precontemplation** ‚Äî Not considering change; unaware or in denial
2. **Contemplation** ‚Äî Aware of problem; ambivalent about change
3. **Preparation** ‚Äî Intending to take action soon; making small changes
4. **Action** ‚Äî Actively changing behavior
5. **Maintenance** ‚Äî Sustaining change over time
6. **Relapse** ‚Äî Return to old behavior (common; part of the process)

**Application to Intervention:**
- Mode selection should match readiness stage
- Precontemplation ‚Üí Mode 2 or 3 (more structure needed)
- Contemplation ‚Üí Mode 1 (collaborative invitation)
- Preparation ‚Üí Mode 1 or 5 (support action steps)

**Source:** Prochaska, J. O., DiClemente, C. C., & Norcross, J. C. (1992). "In search of how people change: Applications to addictive behaviors." *American Psychologist*, 47(9), 1102-1114.

# 6. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

## About the Training

**Q: How long is the full Interventionist Training program?**
**A:** The intensive training is 3 days (24 hours of instruction). After that, you enter a 40-week mentorship program with monthly group calls, 1:1 mentorship, shadowing requirements, and co-facilitation practice.

**Q: Do I need to be in recovery myself to become an interventionist?**
**A:** No. Many interventionists are family members, therapists, or professionals who have been impacted by addiction but are not in personal recovery. If you *are* in recovery, we recommend having at least 2-3 years of stable sobriety before taking on this work.

**Q: Will I be certified after the 3-day training?**
**A:** No. The 3-day training provides foundational knowledge. Certification as a Core Values Interventionist requires completion of the full 40-week mentorship program, including shadowing, co-facilitation, and independent case work.

---

## About the Intervention Continuum

**Q: How do I know which intervention mode to use?**
**A:** Use the Mode Selector Assessment Tool (see [Intervention_Assessment_Tools.md](Intervention_Assessment_Tools.md)). You assess three factors: Safety/Urgency (0-10), Readiness Level (Stages of Change), and Relational Capacity (0-10). The combination of these scores guides your recommendation.

**Q: Can I use more than one mode with the same family?**
**A:** Absolutely. You might start with Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation) and escalate to Mode 2 or 3 if the Pivot Person doesn't engage. Or you might start with Mode 4 (crisis intervention) and transition to Mode 1 for ongoing support.

**Q: What if the family disagrees with my mode recommendation?**
**A:** Educate them about why you're recommending a particular mode based on your assessment. Ultimately, the family decides whether to proceed, but your professional judgment should guide them. If they insist on a mode you believe is unsafe or unethical, you can decline the case.

---

## About Ethics

**Q: Is it ever ethical to lie to the Pivot Person?**
**A:** In Mode 3 (Planned Surprise), the family withholds information about the intervention meeting. This is ethically justifiable *if*:
1. Safety/urgency is high enough to warrant it
2. Dignity is preserved during the meeting
3. The goal is invitation, not coercion
4. Previous collaborative attempts have failed

Outside of that context, deception is generally unethical.

**Q: What if a family offers to pay me extra to place their loved one in a specific treatment center?**
**A:** Decline the extra payment. Accept only your standard intervention fee. Kickbacks or bonuses create a conflict of interest and compromise your professional judgment. Always present multiple treatment options and let the family decide.

**Q: Can I work with a family member or close friend as the Pivot Person?**
**A:** No. This is a dual relationship and violates professional boundaries. Refer the case to another interventionist.

---

## About Logistics & Practice

**Q: How much should I charge for intervention services?**
**A:** Fees vary by region, experience level, and scope of work. Typical ranges:
- Initial consultation: $100-$300
- Intervention planning and facilitation: $2,000-$10,000+ (depending on complexity, number of meetings, travel)
- Sliding scale or pro bono work: Offer when financially sustainable

Research local market rates and set fees that reflect your expertise and the value you provide.

**Q: What if the Pivot Person refuses treatment during the intervention?**
**A:** This happens in 30-50% of interventions. Your role:
1. Validate their feelings: "I understand this feels overwhelming."
2. Explore their concerns: "What feels hardest about saying yes today?"
3. Revisit the invitation: "The treatment center can hold the bed for 24-48 hours. Can you sit with this and we'll talk tomorrow?"
4. Support the family in holding boundaries: "If they say no, what healthy choices will you make for yourselves?"

Document what happened and follow up with the family within 48 hours.

**Q: Do I need malpractice insurance?**
**A:** Yes. If you're facilitating interventions professionally, carry liability insurance. Consult with an insurance broker about coverage for "intervention specialist" or "addiction consulting" services.

---

## About Specific Situations

**Q: What if the Pivot Person has co-occurring mental health issues (depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder)?**
**A:** Co-occurring disorders are common and require specialized treatment. Ensure the treatment center you recommend has dual-diagnosis expertise. If the mental health issue is severe and untreated, consider referring to a psychiatrist or mental health crisis team before proceeding with intervention.

**Q: Can I do an intervention with someone under 18?**
**A:** Yes, but parental consent is required. Adolescent interventions often look different (school-based, outpatient first, family therapy-focused). Consult with adolescent addiction specialists and ensure developmentally appropriate approaches.

**Q: What if the Pivot Person is using fentanyl or other high-risk substances?**
**A:** Urgency is critical. Fentanyl overdose risk is extremely high. This may warrant Mode 3 (surprise) or Mode 4 (crisis) intervention. Have naloxone (Narcan) on hand and be prepared to call 911 if needed. Rapid access to treatment is essential.

**Q: What if the family is not willing to stop enabling?**
**A:** Intervention success depends on the family's willingness to change their own behavior. If the family refuses to set healthy boundaries or continues enabling, the intervention is unlikely to succeed. You may need to focus on family education first before attempting an intervention.
