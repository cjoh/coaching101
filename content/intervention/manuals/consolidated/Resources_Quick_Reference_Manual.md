# Resources & Quick Reference Manual

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## How to Use This Manual

This manual translates the Resources & Quick Reference library into a comprehensive guide you can use before, during, and after intervention assignments. Keep it alongside the Day 1–3 manuals to anchor your practice in shared language, essential tools, and ongoing development pathways.

- **Before an intervention:** Use the assessment, language, and tool primers to prepare families and collaborators.
- **During live work:** Reference the checklists, scripts, and mentoring notes to stay grounded in values-based intervention.
- **After each case:** Document your learning, schedule mentorship touchpoints, and update your resource map.

> **Practice reminder:** When in doubt, return to the Core Values—dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility—then select the tool or resource that helps you express those values in action.

## Section 1: 13 Core Intervention Tools

### Overview

The Core Values intervention toolkit is organized into thirteen interventions that span preparation, live facilitation, and continuing care. The first five tools are practiced intensively during Day 2 (Session 2.4) and form the baseline competencies for all interventionists. The remaining eight are introduced during mentorship and expand your capacity to lead complex cases.

### Five Essential Tools (Day 2 Intensive)

Each essential tool is practiced through hands-on exercises. Mastery requires fluency in purpose, structure, and adaptive use.

#### 1. Impact Letters

- **Purpose:** Give family members a structured way to communicate love, concerns, and requests without shaming the Pivot Person.
- **Core Practices:** Follow the six-part structure (Love, Observation, Impact, Concern, Hope, Request); rehearse delivery; align letters to treatment invitation.
- **Use During Intervention:** Anchor the family meeting; offer clarity when emotions run high; provide written material the Pivot Person can revisit.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Letters are specific, compassionate, and end with a clear invitation; the facilitator can coach edits without rewriting the family’s voice.

#### 2. Safety Planning

- **Purpose:** Ensure immediate physical and psychological safety for the Pivot Person and participating family members.
- **Core Practices:** Screen for medical, suicide, violence, overdose, and withdrawal risks; build layered response plans; document who holds each action.
- **Use During Intervention:** Prior to in-person meetings, during crisis response, and when reassessing risk post-intervention.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Up-to-date safety plan stored with the case file; contingency partners briefed and reachable; interventionist knows how to escalate to emergency services.

#### 3. Motivational Interviewing (MI)

- **Purpose:** Increase intrinsic motivation for change by listening reflectively and evoking the Pivot Person’s own reasons to act.
- **Core Practices:** Use the OARS framework (Open questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries); respond to sustain talk without argument.
- **Use During Intervention:** In one-on-one conversations with the Pivot Person, during family coaching sessions, and when debriefing post-intervention.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Facilitator can surface change talk, avoid righting reflex, and summarize statements that highlight autonomy and hope.

#### 4. Family Meeting Facilitation

- **Purpose:** Guide the live intervention meeting (or series of meetings) with structure, emotional containment, and actionable outcomes.
- **Core Practices:** Establish opening agreements, manage conflict, maintain focus on shared goals, and close with commitments and next steps.
- **Use During Intervention:** Central activity of Modes 1–4; also useful for ongoing family accountability meetings.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Meetings stay within agreed time, each participant is heard, action steps are captured, and the Pivot Person leaves with clarity about supports.

#### 5. Treatment Options Research

- **Purpose:** Present viable treatment pathways aligned with clinical needs, insurance realities, cultural fit, and family resources.
- **Core Practices:** Vet providers across the continuum of care (Detox, Residential, PHP, IOP, Outpatient, Sober Living); confirm admission criteria; plan logistics.
- **Use During Intervention:** Before formal invitation to ensure immediate placement; during family coaching to expand knowledge.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Interventionist prepares at least three aligned options with financial estimates, travel plans, and warm hand-offs to receiving providers.

### Eight Additional Tools (Mentorship Expansion)

Introduced and refined across the 40-week mentorship. These tools deepen your capacity to design engagements, rehearse execution, and sustain post-treatment momentum.

#### 6. Planning & Running Meetings

- **Focus:** Architect multi-stage planning meetings with families and collaborators; build agendas that clarify purpose, process, and follow-up.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 1–8 with supervision on agenda design; practice adjusting cadence based on family readiness.

#### 7. Intervention Rehearsals

- **Focus:** Conduct mock interventions so participants can practice reading letters, regulating emotions, and navigating objections.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 5–16; mentor observes at least one rehearsal and delivers coaching on tone, pacing, and language.

#### 8. Aftercare Support

- **Focus:** Design sustained recovery plans that include clinical, community, and family supports beyond initial treatment.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 13–28; integrate relapse-prevention strategies, healthy choice agreements, and accountability measures.

#### 9. Core Values Recovery Model

- **Focus:** Blend family coaching, individual coaching, and case management into a unified care map; ensure services reinforce the four Core Values.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 9–40; case presentations emphasize how supports align with dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility.

#### 10. Recovery Meetings (12-Step, etc.)

- **Focus:** Connect families and the Pivot Person to peer-led communities (AA, NA, Al-Anon, SMART Recovery, etc.) that offer ongoing accountability.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 9–24; build scripts for invitations, transportation plans, and relapse response protocols.

#### 11. Accountability Monitoring

- **Focus:** Incorporate breathalyzers, drug testing, and other verification tools ethically and in partnership with the family.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 13–32; evaluate when monitoring supports growth versus when it becomes punitive.

#### 12. Emergency Response

- **Focus:** Activate rapid-response pathways for overdose, relapse, self-harm, or violence; coordinate with medical and legal professionals.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 1–40; simulation drills ensure interventionists can lead de-escalation while maintaining their own safety.

#### 13. One-on-One Support

- **Focus:** Provide individual sessions to the Pivot Person or family members when group convenings are not possible.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 17–40; integrate MI, solution-focused coaching, and safety assessments in every touchpoint.

### 5-Mode Intervention Continuum

The thirteen tools are deployed across five intervention modes. Selecting the right mode ensures proper pacing and containment.

| Mode | Primary Conditions | Tool Emphasis | Interventionist Focus |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Mode 1: Collaborative | Pivot Person is willing and engaged | Family Meeting Facilitation, MI, Treatment Research | Co-create plans, amplify intrinsic motivation |
| Mode 2: Structured | Pivot Person is ambivalent or inconsistent | Impact Letters, Rehearsals, Planning Meetings | Increase clarity, strengthen family alignment |
| Mode 3: Planned | Pivot Person is resistant; significant risk indicators | Safety Planning, Emergency Response, Accountability Monitoring | Manage risk, coordinate decisive invitations |
| Mode 4: Crisis | Immediate safety threats require rapid action | Emergency Response, Safety Planning, One-on-One Support | Protect life and stabilize; involve authorities as needed |
| Mode 5: Individual | Family unavailable or unsafe | One-on-One Support, MI, Aftercare Support | Build alliance with Pivot Person, coordinate external supports |

> **Application Tip:** Before launching any intervention activity, clarify the current mode with your supervising mentor. Modes can shift mid-case—document transitions and adjust tools accordingly.

## Section 2: Core Values Language Reference

Language shapes perception. The Core Values lexicon reduces stigma, reinforces partnership, and keeps dignity centered.

### Key Terms and Practice Notes

| Preferred Language | Use When | Avoid | Why It Matters | Practice Prompt |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Pivot Person | Referring to the individual at the center of the intervention | Labels like "addict," "alcoholic," "IP" | Highlights agency and central role without stigma | "When I speak with the Pivot Person, I will name their strengths before making requests." |
| Healthy Choices | Coaching families on boundary-setting | "Boundaries" framed as punishment | Emphasizes proactive care instead of defensive detachment | "What healthy choice do you want to make when the Pivot Person declines help?" |
| Person with substance use disorder | Discussing clinical status or history | Diagnostic shorthand that reduces personhood | Reinforces person-first language, aligns with ethical standards | "Describe the person, not the problem. What values are they trying to live by?" |
| Recovery is a team sport | Opening or closing family meetings | Messaging that isolates or blames the Pivot Person | Shifts focus to systemic healing and shared responsibility | "List the team members supporting recovery this week and their next action." |

### Facilitator Practices

- Begin every meeting by modeling the preferred language; invite the family to correct each other gently when old habits surface.
- Capture quotes highlight the new language in session notes to reinforce culture change.
- When documents from other providers use stigmatizing terms, translate them before sharing with the family to maintain alignment.

## Section 3: Family Systems Assessment Toolkit

Effective interventions require a layered understanding of the family system. Use these factors and prompts during intake, ongoing case reviews, and supervision.

### Key Assessment Factors

1. **Safety**
   - Screen for immediate risks: overdose history, suicidal behaviors, violence, weapon access.
   - Identify who will activate emergency services and under what triggers.
2. **Urgency**
   - Determine crisis status versus planned engagement; map timelines for treatment availability.
   - Clarify financial, legal, or medical deadlines influencing decisions.
3. **Readiness**
   - Gauge the Pivot Person’s awareness and willingness using MI conversations and collateral reports.
   - Assess family readiness—are they prepared to change their own behaviors?
4. **Relational Capacity**
   - Map alliances, fractures, and communication patterns.
   - Note who soothes conflict, who escalates, and who withdraws.

### Dynamics to Observe

- **Enabling Patterns:** Who protects the status quo? What needs keep them in that role?
- **Roles & Narratives:** Who is the historian, the rescuer, the scapegoat? How do these roles shift under stress?
- **Communication Styles:** Do they rely on indirect hints, heated arguments, or silence? What new scripts could be introduced?
- **Cultural Context:** Identify traditions, spiritual frameworks, and community expectations that influence help-seeking.
- **Family Strengths:** Document resilience, humor, shared values, and prior moments of successful collaboration.

### Assessment Workflow

1. **Pre-Intake Preparation:** Review referral notes, align on safety thresholds, and prepare culturally informed questions.
2. **Initial Interviews:** Conduct individual conversations before hosting group dialogues; record consent for information-sharing.
3. **Case Mapping Session:** Build a visual or narrative map of the system (use the Family System Mapping Template) and highlight leverage points.
4. **Action Planning:** Translate insights into healthy choice agreements and intervention mode selection.
5. **Supervision Review:** Present findings to your mentor within 72 hours to validate assumptions and address blind spots.

## Section 4: Impact Letters Lab

Impact Letters are both an intervention tool and a relational repair practice. This section provides detailed guidance for coaching families through the writing process.

### Six-Part Structure (With Coaching Prompts)

1. **Opening (Love):** “I love you and I am writing this because…”  
   - Prompt: Ask the writer to anchor in shared memories or values.
2. **Specific Observations (Observation):** “I’ve noticed…”  
   - Prompt: Use dates, behaviors, and neutral descriptions; avoid diagnoses.
3. **Personal Impact (Impact):** “This has affected me by…”  
   - Prompt: Encourage naming feelings and consequences without blame.
4. **Concern (Concern):** “I’m worried that…”  
   - Prompt: Connect observations to risks (health, relationships, safety).
5. **Hope (Hope):** “I believe you can…”  
   - Prompt: Highlight strengths and past successes; invite possibility.
6. **Request (Request):** “I’m asking you to consider…”  
   - Prompt: Align requests with researched treatment options; offer practical support.

### Facilitating the Writing Process

- **Timeline:** Allocate at least one week between draft one and final rehearsal.
- **Coaching Touchpoints:** Schedule two review calls per letter—first for content alignment, second for tone and delivery.
- **Delivery Practice:** During rehearsals, have writers speak slowly, breathe between sections, and maintain eye contact.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid ultimatums, sarcasm, or mixed messages (“You can stay if…”); revise any statements that undermine autonomy.

### Documentation Checklist

- Save final letters in encrypted case files.
- Record who will read in the live meeting and in what sequence.
- Note any letters that will be delivered privately to maintain safety.
