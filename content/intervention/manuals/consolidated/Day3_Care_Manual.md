# Day 3: Care — Practice, Integration, and Reflection

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Overview: The Day of Practice

Welcome to Day 3—**Care**. After two days of building awareness and learning coordination skills, today is about **embodiment**. This is the day you step into the role of interventionist through live practice, receive feedback from peers and facilitators, process the emotional weight of this work, and prepare for the 40-week mentorship journey ahead.

Today is not about perfection. It is about **presence, courage, and integration**. You will practice facilitating interventions through structured roleplays, navigate complex family dynamics in real time, and learn what it feels like to hold space for families in crisis. You will also discover your strengths, identify your growing edges, and build the foundation for ongoing learning.

### What Makes Day 3 Different

The first two days were about **learning**. Today is about **doing**.

You will move from theory to practice, from observation to facilitation, from understanding to embodiment. The roleplays you participate in today will be challenging—they are designed to surface the complexity, uncertainty, and emotional intensity of real intervention work. This is intentional. We practice hard things in safe spaces so that when you sit with real families, you are prepared.

**Care** is the third pillar of Core Values intervention. It is where awareness and coordination come together in service of families. Care is not soft—it is rigorous, adaptive, and accountable. It requires vulnerability, humility, and the courage to stay present even when outcomes are uncertain.

---

## Day 3 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will be able to:

1. **Facilitate structured intervention roleplays** with trauma-informed awareness and adaptive responsiveness
2. **Provide and receive constructive feedback** using the Core Values framework
3. **Apply trauma-informed care principles** to intervention settings, creating safety and choice for all participants
4. **Navigate complex family dynamics** in real time, including resistance, emotional escalation, and system patterns
5. **Process your own emotional responses** to intervention work with self-awareness and accountability
6. **Understand the 40-week mentorship structure** and articulate your commitment to ongoing learning and supervision
7. **Integrate the full 3-day training experience** into a personal practice framework that honors your strengths and acknowledges your growing edges

## Session 3.1: Morning Check-In & Intention-Setting (9:00–9:30 AM)

### Purpose

Day 3 begins with grounding. Before stepping into the intensity of roleplay practice, we create space for participants to arrive fully—body, mind, and heart. This session is about **readiness assessment**, intention-setting, and building group safety for the vulnerable work ahead.

### Why This Matters

Intervention practice is emotionally demanding. Participants may feel nervous, excited, uncertain, or vulnerable. Creating space to name these feelings—and to articulate what support is needed—builds psychological safety and sets the tone for a day of courageous practice.

The morning check-in also serves as a **baseline assessment**. By asking participants to reflect on their physical, mental, and emotional state, facilitators can identify anyone who may need additional support or modified participation during the day.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin the day with a brief grounding exercise:

> "Good morning. We've spent two days building awareness and learning coordination skills. Today is about practice—stepping into the role of interventionist and discovering what you are capable of. Before we begin, let's take a moment to ground ourselves in this space."

**Lead a 2-minute grounding practice:**

- "Close your eyes if that feels comfortable. Take three deep breaths."
- "Notice where you are—the sounds, the temperature, the feeling of your feet on the floor."
- "Notice what you're bringing into this room today—energy, nervousness, excitement, fatigue. Whatever it is, it's welcome here."
- "Set an intention for yourself: What do you want to learn or practice today?"

After the grounding, transition to the reflection prompts:

> "We're going to start with a few reflection questions. Please take your time with these—they're just for you, though you'll have the option to share with the group if you'd like."

---

**Reflection Prompts (20 minutes)**

Guide participants through the following prompts, allowing time for individual reflection before inviting group sharing:

1. **How I'm feeling this morning (body, mind, heart):**
   - *"Check in with yourself. What's your energy level? How's your mental clarity? What emotions are present?"*
   - Facilitator note: Watch for signs of fatigue, anxiety, or overwhelm. If someone shares significant distress, check in with them privately during the break.

2. **My intention for today's role-plays:**
   - *"What do you want to practice or learn today? This isn't about performing perfectly—it's about growth."*
   - Examples participants might name: staying present under pressure, managing my own emotions, practicing the opening script, handling resistance with grace.

3. **One thing I'm nervous about:**
   - *"It's normal to feel nervous. What feels challenging or uncertain for you today?"*
   - Normalize nervousness: "If you're not at least a little nervous, you're probably not taking this seriously enough. This work matters, and it's okay to feel the weight of it."

4. **One strength I bring to today:**
   - *"What are you confident in? What skills, experiences, or qualities do you already have that will serve you well?"*
   - Encourage participants to name specific strengths: listening skills, lived experience, calm presence, ability to hold space for emotions.

5. **Support I need from the group today:**
   - *"What would help you learn and practice today? What do you need from your peers and facilitators?"*
   - Examples: honest feedback, patience, encouragement, reminders to breathe.

---

**Group Sharing (Optional — 5 minutes)**

Invite a few volunteers to share one of their reflections with the group. Do not require everyone to share—this is about creating space for connection, not performance.

After sharing, close the session:

> "Thank you for your honesty and your presence. Today is going to be challenging, and it's also going to be transformative. We're in this together. Let's move into the day with courage and care."

---

### Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Choice**: Participants are not required to share aloud. Written reflection is sufficient.
- **Pacing**: Do not rush. Allow silence and processing time.
- **Safety**: If someone shares significant distress (e.g., "I didn't sleep last night because I'm terrified"), check in privately and offer options for modified participation.
- **Empowerment**: Frame nervousness as appropriate, not as a deficit. Normalize the emotional weight of this work.

---

## Session 3.2: Trauma-Informed Practice & Case Prep (9:30–10:15 AM)

### Purpose

Before participants step into intervention roleplays, they need a **trauma-informed framework** to guide their practice. This session introduces the principles of trauma-informed care, explains how trauma shows up in intervention settings, and provides practical strategies for creating safety, choice, and empowerment.

The second half of the session transitions into **case preparation**, where participants finalize their roleplay scenarios, confirm roles, and rehearse their opening scripts.

---

### Why This Matters

Families in crisis are often carrying significant trauma—historical, intergenerational, and current. The Pivot Person may have experienced trauma related to their substance use (violence, overdose, legal consequences) or unrelated trauma that predates their addiction (childhood abuse, loss, systemic oppression).

If interventionists do not understand trauma, they risk **re-traumatizing** participants through coercive language, lack of choice, or failure to recognize trauma responses (dissociation, hypervigilance, shutdown).

Trauma-informed intervention is not just about being kind—it is about **creating conditions where healing is possible**. This requires intentionality, skill, and self-awareness.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Part 1: Trauma-Informed Framework (20 minutes)**

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin with a brief framing of trauma in intervention work:

> "Intervention work brings us into contact with families in their most vulnerable moments. Many of the people we serve—both Pivot Persons and family members—are carrying significant trauma. As interventionists, our responsibility is not to provide trauma therapy—that is the role of licensed clinicians. But we must understand trauma so that we do not inadvertently cause harm."

Ask the group:

> "How many of you have experienced trauma in your own life?"

(Pause. Do not require anyone to answer aloud.)

> "How many of you have witnessed trauma responses in others—shutdown, anger, dissociation, hypervigilance?"

(Pause.)

> "Trauma is not rare. It is common. And it shapes how people respond to stress, vulnerability, and change. Today, we're going to learn how to recognize trauma responses and create safety in our intervention work."

---

**The 5 Principles of Trauma-Informed Care (10 minutes)**

Present the five principles of trauma-informed care using the acronym **STCCE**:

1. **Safety** — Physical and emotional safety for all participants
2. **Trustworthiness** — Consistency, transparency, and follow-through
3. **Choice** — Honoring autonomy and avoiding coercion
4. **Collaboration** — Shared decision-making and partnership
5. **Empowerment** — Recognizing strengths and building agency

For each principle, provide a specific example of how it applies to intervention work:

- **Safety**: "We start every intervention with a clear explanation of what will happen, who will speak, and what the Pivot Person can expect. We do not surprise or ambush."
- **Trustworthiness**: "We follow through on what we say. If we tell the Pivot Person they can take a break, we honor that—even if it interrupts the flow of the intervention."
- **Choice**: "We invite, we do not coerce. The Pivot Person always has the choice to say no. Our job is to create conditions where 'yes' becomes possible, not to force it."
- **Collaboration**: "We involve the Pivot Person in decision-making. We ask, 'What would feel most helpful to you right now?' rather than dictating the process."
- **Empowerment**: "We reflect strengths, not just problems. We remind the Pivot Person of their resilience, their values, and their capacity for change."

---

**Recognizing Trauma Responses (5 minutes)**

Explain common trauma responses that may show up during interventions:

- **Fight**: Anger, defensiveness, blame, aggression
- **Flight**: Avoidance, leaving the room, shutting down conversation
- **Freeze**: Dissociation, numbness, emotional flatness, silence
- **Fawn**: People-pleasing, false compliance, saying "yes" without meaning it

Emphasize:

> "None of these responses are personal. They are survival strategies. When someone becomes defensive or shuts down, they are not 'resisting change'—they are responding to perceived threat. Our job is to reduce the threat by creating safety."

**Practical Application:**

Ask participants to reflect:

> "In your workbook, write down: What signs of trauma might you see during interventions? How will you create safety in today's roleplays?"

Allow 3 minutes for individual reflection. Invite a few participants to share their responses aloud.

---

**Part 2: Case Study Preparation (25 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "Now we're going to shift from theory to practice. Each group has been working on a case study over the past two days. It's time to finalize your scenario and prepare for the roleplay."

**Group Work Time (20 minutes)**

Break participants into their roleplay groups (3–5 people per group). Each group should have:

- A case study scenario (provided on Day 1 or Day 2)
- Assigned roles (Interventionist, Pivot Person, family members)
- A confirmed intervention mode (structured, collaborative, crisis, etc.)

Guide groups through the following preparation steps:

1. **Confirm the intervention mode:**
   - What type of intervention are you practicing? (Structured family meeting, collaborative check-in, crisis intervention, etc.)

2. **Review the scenario details:**
   - Who is the Pivot Person? What is their substance use pattern?
   - Who are the family members? What are their relationships and roles?
   - What is the family's goal for the intervention?

3. **Assign roles clearly:**
   - Who is facilitating as the interventionist?
   - Who is playing the Pivot Person?
   - Who are the family members?
   - Is there a co-facilitator or observer?

4. **Rehearse the opening script:**
   - The interventionist should practice their opening 2–3 times. This is the most important moment of the intervention—it sets the tone for everything that follows.
   - Example opening: *"Thank you for being here. I know this is hard. Today, the people who love you most want to share what they've been experiencing and talk about next steps. You don't have to agree with everything you hear, and you don't have to make any decisions right now. What we're asking is that you listen with an open heart."*

5. **Plan the speaker order:**
   - Who speaks first? Second? Third?
   - What are the key points each family member wants to express?
   - Reminder: Family members should speak from **values and connection**, not blame or shame.

6. **Readiness check:**
   - On a scale of 1–10, how ready does each person feel?
   - What support does the group need from facilitators or observers?

---

**Facilitator Coaching (3 minutes)**

Walk around the room during group work time. Check in with each group. Offer coaching on:

- Opening scripts that feel too clinical or too informal
- Family member letters that slip into blame or shame
- Interventionists who seem uncertain or overwhelmed

Provide specific, actionable feedback:

- "That opening is great, but let's slow it down. Pause after 'thank you for being here' and make eye contact before continuing."
- "That family member statement is powerful, but let's reframe 'You're destroying this family' to 'I feel like we're losing connection with you, and that scares me.'"

---

**Close the Session (2 minutes)**

> "You've done excellent preparation work. In a few minutes, we're going to begin the first round of roleplays. Remember: this is practice. You are allowed to make mistakes. You are allowed to pause and ask for coaching. The goal is not perfection—it's learning."

---

### Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: Participants may feel vulnerable stepping into emotionally intense roles. Normalize nervousness and offer permission to pause or modify roles if needed.
- **Choice**: No one should be forced to play a role that feels triggering. Offer alternative roles (observer, note-taker) if someone needs to step back.
- **Collaboration**: Groups should work together to prepare, not compete. Emphasize that everyone is learning together.
- **Empowerment**: Recognize the courage it takes to practice in front of peers. Name it explicitly: "This is brave work."

---

## Session 3.3A: Role-Play Round 1 (10:15–11:30 AM)

### Purpose

This is the heart of Day 3—**live intervention practice**. Two groups will present their intervention scenarios, each receiving 30 minutes of roleplay time plus 15 minutes of structured feedback. The remaining participants observe, take notes, and prepare to offer constructive feedback.

The goal of this session is to create a **safe, structured, and supportive environment** for practicing intervention skills. Participants will learn by doing, by watching, and by reflecting on what worked and what didn't.

---

### Why This Matters

You cannot learn intervention work from a book. You can only learn by practicing—by stepping into the role, feeling the emotional weight of it, navigating uncertainty in real time, and receiving feedback from peers who see what you cannot see in the moment.

Roleplays are not simulations of real interventions—they are **practice spaces** where mistakes are expected, welcomed, and used as learning opportunities. The feedback participants receive today will shape their practice for years to come.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Opening Frame (5 minutes)**

Before the first roleplay begins, set the tone for the session:

> "We're about to begin the first round of roleplays. This is the moment you've been preparing for over the past two days. Before we start, I want to remind you of a few things:"

**Three Ground Rules for Roleplays:**

1. **This is practice, not performance.**
   - "You are allowed to make mistakes. In fact, you're supposed to make mistakes—that's how we learn. If you feel stuck during the roleplay, you can pause and ask for coaching. There are no perfect interventions."

2. **Stay in character until we call 'scene.'**
   - "Once the roleplay begins, commit to your role. Even if something feels awkward or unrealistic, stay with it. We'll debrief afterward."

3. **Feedback is a gift.**
   - "We're going to use a structured feedback model that starts with strengths, names what worked, and offers growth opportunities. Feedback is not criticism—it's care. Receive it with openness."

---

**Roleplay Structure (30 minutes per group)**

Each roleplay follows this structure:

**1. Setup (2 minutes)**
- The group introduces their scenario: who the Pivot Person is, who the family members are, what the family's goal is for the intervention.
- The interventionist briefly explains what intervention mode they are using (structured, collaborative, etc.).

**2. Roleplay (20 minutes)**
- The roleplay begins. Facilitators do **not** interrupt unless:
  - Someone is unsafe (emotionally or physically)
  - The roleplay has gone completely off track
  - Someone breaks character and asks for help

- Facilitators and observers take notes on:
  - What the interventionist did well
  - Effective moments (what worked)
  - Growth opportunities (what could be improved)

**3. Pause for Reflection (3 minutes)**
- After 20 minutes, call "scene."
- Ask the interventionist: *"How are you feeling? What was that like for you?"*
- Ask the Pivot Person: *"What was it like to be on the receiving end of that intervention?"*
- Ask the family members: *"What did you notice from your perspective?"*

**4. Structured Feedback (15 minutes)**
- Use the **Strengths → Effective Moments → Growth Opportunities** model (see below).

---

**Structured Feedback Model**

Feedback follows this sequence:

**Step 1: The interventionist reflects first (2 minutes)**

Ask the interventionist:

- "What do you think went well?"
- "What felt challenging?"
- "If you could do it again, what would you change?"

This step is critical—it allows the interventionist to process their own experience before receiving feedback from others.

---

**Step 2: Observers name strengths (3 minutes)**

Invite observers to name **specific strengths** they noticed. Use the prompt:

- "What did the interventionist do well?"

Examples of strengths to name:

- "You started with a clear, compassionate opening that created safety."
- "When the Pivot Person got defensive, you stayed calm and didn't take it personally."
- "You used reflective listening—'What I'm hearing is…'—which helped the Pivot Person feel heard."
- "You managed time well and kept the conversation focused."

Facilitator note: Do not allow vague praise ("You did great!"). Push for specificity: "What exactly did they do that was effective?"

---

**Step 3: Observers name effective moments (3 minutes)**

Invite observers to name **specific moments that worked**. Use the prompt:

- "What moments landed well? What interventions were particularly effective?"

Examples:

- "When the mother started crying, you paused and acknowledged her emotions before moving on. That was powerful."
- "When the Pivot Person said, 'I don't need help,' you didn't argue—you said, 'I hear you. Let's just listen to what your family has to say.' That was a great reframe."
- "The way you invited the father to speak first—that was strategic. His calm presence set a good tone."

---

**Step 4: Facilitators and observers offer growth opportunities (5 minutes)**

Now shift to constructive feedback. Use the phrase **"growth opportunities"** instead of "criticism" or "mistakes."

Examples:

- "One thing to consider: your opening was clear, but it felt a little rushed. Slowing down and making eye contact would create more connection."
- "When the Pivot Person interrupted a family member, you let it slide. In a real intervention, you'd want to gently redirect: 'Let's let Mom finish, and then I'll make sure you have time to respond.'"
- "I noticed you used a lot of clinical language—'substance use disorder,' 'treatment plan.' Families don't always connect with that language. Try values-based language instead: 'reconnecting with what matters most to you.'"

Facilitator note: Balance honesty with compassion. The goal is to help the person grow, not to make them feel inadequate.

---

**Step 5: Close with affirmation (2 minutes)**

End the feedback session by naming the courage it took to step into the role:

> "Thank you for your willingness to practice in front of the group. That takes real courage. You gave us all something to learn from."

---

**Repeat for Second Group**

Follow the same structure for the second group's roleplay.

---

### Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: Roleplays can be emotionally activating, especially for participants with personal history related to addiction or family conflict. Watch for signs of distress and offer the option to step out if needed.
- **Choice**: Participants should not be forced to continue a roleplay if it becomes overwhelming. Allow people to pause and step back.
- **Trustworthiness**: Honor the feedback structure. Do not allow feedback to become harsh or shaming.
- **Collaboration**: Emphasize that everyone is learning together—there are no experts in the room, just practitioners committed to growth.
- **Empowerment**: Name strengths explicitly and often. People learn best when they know what they are doing well, not just what needs improvement.

---

**Observation Notes for Participants**

While observing roleplays, participants should take notes using the workbook prompts:

**Scenario 1:**
- What the interventionist did well
- Effective moments (what worked)
- Growth opportunities (constructive feedback)

**Scenario 2:**
- What the interventionist did well
- Effective moments (what worked)
- Growth opportunities (constructive feedback)

These notes will inform group feedback and help participants internalize what effective intervention looks like.

---

**BREAK (11:30–11:45 AM — 15 minutes)**

After the intensity of two roleplays, participants need a reset. Encourage people to:

- Step outside for fresh air
- Stretch and move their bodies
- Hydrate and snack
- Decompress emotionally

Facilitator note: Check in with anyone who seemed distressed during the roleplays.

---

## Session 3.3B: Role-Play Round 2 (11:45 AM–12:45 PM)

### Purpose

The second round of roleplays continues the practice and feedback cycle. Depending on group size, this session may include 1–2 additional scenarios. The focus shifts slightly from individual performance to **pattern recognition**—noticing what strategies work across multiple scenarios and what common challenges emerge.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Opening (3 minutes)**

> "We've seen two powerful roleplays this morning. Now we're going to continue with additional scenarios. As you observe this round, I want you to start noticing patterns: What strategies seem to work across different scenarios? What challenges keep coming up?"

---

**Roleplay Structure (Same as Round 1)**

Follow the same structure as Session 3.3A:

- Setup (2 minutes)
- Roleplay (20 minutes)
- Pause for reflection (3 minutes)
- Structured feedback (15 minutes)

If time allows, facilitate a second roleplay using the same structure.

---

**Integration Discussion (15 minutes)**

After the final roleplay, facilitate a brief integration discussion:

**Prompt 1: Patterns Across Scenarios**

> "What patterns are you noticing across all the roleplays? What strategies seem to work consistently?"

Examples participants might name:

- Slowing down the opening creates safety
- Reflecting emotions back to speakers helps them feel heard
- Staying calm when the Pivot Person gets defensive prevents escalation
- Using values-based language (connection, care, hope) is more effective than clinical language

---

**Prompt 2: Common Challenges**

> "What challenges keep coming up? What seems hardest for interventionists to navigate?"

Examples participants might name:

- Managing time—knowing when to let someone speak longer and when to move on
- Handling resistance without becoming defensive
- Staying present when emotions run high
- Balancing compassion with structure

---

**Prompt 3: Personal Insights**

> "What's something you learned about yourself by observing or participating in these roleplays?"

Allow a few participants to share. Close with:

> "You've done incredible work this morning. Let's take a lunch break, and we'll come back this afternoon to process what came up."

---

**Personal Roleplay Reflection (In Workbook)**

Participants who facilitated or played roles during the session should complete the following reflection prompts during lunch or later in the afternoon:

- **My role in the simulation:** (e.g., Interventionist, Pivot Person, family member)
- **What felt most challenging:** (Difficult moments, uncertainties)
- **What surprised me:** (Insights or breakthroughs)
- **Feedback I received from observers:** (Constructive feedback from the group)
- **Key takeaway from all simulations:** (What I'm taking forward from this practice)

---

**LUNCH BREAK (12:45–1:45 PM — 60 minutes)**

Participants need extended time to eat, decompress, and process the emotional intensity of the morning. Encourage self-care during lunch—people should not feel obligated to debrief or discuss the roleplays unless they want to.

---

## Session 3.4: Trauma-Informed Debrief (1:45–2:45 PM)

### Purpose

The afternoon begins with a **trauma-informed debrief**—a structured process for helping participants process the emotional and psychological impact of the morning's roleplays. This session is not about feedback or analysis—it is about **emotional integration, self-care, and making meaning** of what came up.

Intervention work is emotionally demanding. Participants may have experienced activation, triggers, or personal connections to the scenarios. The debrief creates space to acknowledge these responses, normalize them, and develop self-care strategies for managing the emotional weight of this work.

---

### Why This Matters

Without proper debriefing, participants may carry unprocessed emotions into future work—leading to burnout, compassion fatigue, or secondary trauma. Trauma-informed debriefing teaches participants **how to care for themselves** so they can sustainably care for others.

This session also reinforces the principle that **self-awareness is a professional competency**. Effective interventionists know their triggers, manage their emotions, and seek support when needed.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Opening Frame (5 minutes)**

Begin with a grounding exercise:

> "This morning was intense. You stepped into emotionally challenging roles, witnessed difficult family dynamics, and practiced skills that felt unfamiliar. Before we move forward, we need to pause and process what came up. This is not optional—it's essential. If we don't process the emotional weight of this work, we carry it with us, and it becomes a burden."

Lead a brief grounding practice:

- "Close your eyes and take three deep breaths."
- "Notice where you are. Notice that you are safe."
- "Notice any emotions or sensations in your body—tightness, tension, sadness, fatigue. Just notice, without judgment."
- "Take one more deep breath and open your eyes when you're ready."

---

**TiPS Framework: Processing the Roleplay Experience (30 minutes)**

Introduce the **TiPS framework (Trauma-informed Practice Strategies)** for processing intense experiences:

**T — Feelings and reactions that came up**
**i — Connections to my own story**
**P — Self-care plan**
**S — When to seek support**

Guide participants through each component:

---

**1. What feelings or reactions came up for me (10 minutes)**

Ask participants to reflect individually:

> "What emotions or reactions came up during the roleplays? This could be during your own roleplay or while observing others. There are no wrong answers."

Examples to normalize:

- Sadness or grief (recognizing the pain families experience)
- Anger or frustration (at the Pivot Person, at enabling family members)
- Anxiety or overwhelm (feeling the weight of responsibility)
- Disconnection or numbness (a trauma response to emotional intensity)
- Joy or hope (witnessing connection and vulnerability)

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share aloud. Use prompts:

- "Who's willing to name one emotion that came up for you today?"
- "What body sensations did you notice? Tightness? Tears? Fatigue?"

Facilitator note: Do not force anyone to share. Create space, then honor silence.

---

**2. Connections to my own story (10 minutes)**

> "Sometimes, intervention work touches our own stories—our own experiences with addiction, family conflict, or loss. If anything in today's roleplays resonated with your personal experience, take a moment to name it."

Examples:

- "The Pivot Person's resistance reminded me of my own resistance when my family tried to help me."
- "The mother's grief brought up my own feelings about losing someone to addiction."
- "I noticed myself getting defensive when the family member used shaming language—because I've been on the receiving end of that."

Emphasize:

> "These connections are not weaknesses—they are part of what makes you effective as an interventionist. Your lived experience is an asset. But we have to be aware of when our own story is influencing our reactions so it doesn't cloud our judgment."

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share if they feel comfortable.

---

**3. How I'll care for myself after intense practice (5 minutes)**

> "Intervention work takes a toll. If you don't care for yourself, you will burn out. Self-care is not optional—it is a professional responsibility."

Ask participants to write down at least **three self-care strategies** they will use today and in future intervention work. Examples:

- Physical: exercise, sleep, nutrition, movement
- Emotional: talking to a friend, journaling, therapy, peer support
- Spiritual: meditation, prayer, time in nature, creative expression
- Professional: supervision, consultation, peer debriefing

---

**4. When I'll seek consultation or supervision (5 minutes)**

> "You will not be able to handle every intervention alone. Knowing when to seek support is a sign of competence, not weakness."

Ask participants to reflect:

> "What red flags would tell you that you need consultation or supervision?"

Examples to name:

- A case that triggers your own trauma or strong emotional reactions
- A Pivot Person who is suicidal or at immediate risk of harm
- Family dynamics that feel unsafe or abusive
- Uncertainty about your role or scope of practice
- Feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or emotionally depleted

Emphasize:

> "If you don't know what to do, you ask. If you feel out of your depth, you ask. If something feels ethically murky, you ask. That's what the 40-week mentorship is for—so you never have to figure this out alone."

---

**Trauma-Informed Interventionist Practice (15 minutes)**

Transition from personal processing to professional application:

> "Now that we've processed our own responses, let's talk about how we apply trauma-informed care in real intervention settings."

---

**Discussion Prompt 1: Signs of trauma I might see in intervention work**

Ask participants:

> "What signs of trauma might you see when working with families?"

Examples to name:

- **In Pivot Persons**: defensiveness, dissociation, emotional shutdown, hypervigilance, self-blame
- **In family members**: anger, enabling behaviors, emotional flooding, caretaking, avoidance
- **In the system**: triangulation (two people talking about a third), scapegoating, rigid roles, lack of boundaries

---

**Discussion Prompt 2: How I'll create safety in intervention settings**

Ask participants:

> "How will you create safety during interventions?"

Examples to name:

- **Language**: Use invitational language ("Would you be willing to…") rather than commands
- **Pacing**: Slow down. Pause between speakers. Allow silence.
- **Choice**: Remind the Pivot Person they can take breaks, ask questions, or stop the intervention if needed
- **Control**: Give the Pivot Person as much control as possible over the process (where they sit, who speaks first, etc.)
- **Transparency**: Explain what will happen, who will be there, and what the family is hoping for

---

**Discussion Prompt 3: When I'll seek consultation or supervision**

Reinforce the earlier reflection by asking:

> "What situations would make you reach out for consultation or supervision?"

Examples:

- Complex cases involving co-occurring disorders (mental health + substance use)
- Cases involving domestic violence, child abuse, or other safety concerns
- Cases where you feel personally triggered or emotionally reactive
- Cases where the family has unrealistic expectations (e.g., "We want you to force them into treatment")

Close the section:

> "Trauma-informed intervention is not about having all the answers. It's about creating conditions where healing becomes possible—and knowing when you need support to do that well."

---

### Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: This session may bring up difficult emotions. Have tissues available, normalize tears, and offer permission to step out if needed.
- **Choice**: Participants should not be required to share personal connections to the work. Honor privacy.
- **Trustworthiness**: Model the self-care and boundary-setting you are teaching. If you as a facilitator are exhausted, name it: "I need to take a short break before we continue."
- **Collaboration**: Emphasize that everyone in the room is learning together—facilitators included.
- **Empowerment**: Reinforce that self-awareness is a strength, not a weakness. Knowing your limits is part of being a competent interventionist.

---

**BREAK (2:45–3:05 PM — 20 minutes)**

This is an extended break after emotionally heavy content. Encourage participants to:

- Step outside
- Move their bodies
- Call a friend or support person if needed
- Rest

---

## Session 3.5: Mentorship Program Overview (3:05–3:35 PM)

### Purpose

The 3-day training is just the beginning. To become a certified **Core Values Interventionist**, participants will complete a **40-week mentorship program** that includes ongoing supervision, case consultation, and accountability. This session provides a detailed overview of the mentorship structure, expectations, and next steps.

---

### Why This Matters

Intervention work is complex, high-stakes, and emotionally demanding. No one becomes a competent interventionist after three days of training. The mentorship program provides the **structure, support, and accountability** necessary for participants to develop their skills, build confidence, and practice ethically.

This session also serves as a **commitment checkpoint**. Participants need to understand what they are committing to and assess whether they have the time, resources, and readiness to complete the mentorship.

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin by acknowledging the transition from training to practice:

> "You've completed three days of intensive learning and practice. You've built awareness, learned coordination skills, and practiced intervention facilitation. But this is just the beginning. To become a certified Core Values Interventionist, you'll participate in a 40-week mentorship program that provides ongoing supervision and support as you build your practice."

---

**40-Week Mentorship Structure (15 minutes)**

Present the mentorship structure using the three-phase model:

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1–12)**

**Focus**: Learning by observation and supervised practice

**Activities**:
- **Weekly supervision calls** (30 minutes) with your Core Values mentor
- **Case observation**: Shadow experienced interventionists during live interventions
- **Skill development**: Practice specific skills (opening scripts, managing resistance, family communication)
- **Documentation**: Maintain a learning journal and case notes

**Outcomes**: By the end of Phase 1, participants should be able to:
- Articulate the Core Values model to families
- Facilitate a basic family meeting with supervision
- Recognize when they need support or consultation

---

**Phase 2: Guided Practice (Weeks 13–28)**

**Focus**: Co-facilitated interventions and case consultation

**Activities**:
- **Bi-weekly supervision calls** (45 minutes)
- **Co-facilitated interventions**: Lead interventions with mentor support
- **Case consultation**: Bring your own cases for group and individual review
- **Peer learning**: Participate in monthly peer cohort meetings

**Outcomes**: By the end of Phase 2, participants should be able to:
- Lead structured and collaborative interventions with mentor backup
- Navigate common challenges (resistance, family conflict, ambivalence)
- Coordinate care teams effectively

---

**Phase 3: Independent Practice (Weeks 29–40)**

**Focus**: Independent facilitation with supervision and final case review

**Activities**:
- **Monthly supervision calls** (60 minutes)
- **Lead interventions independently** with supervisor available for consultation
- **Final case review**: Present 10 documented intervention cases for certification review
- **Continuing education**: Participate in Core Values advanced training modules

**Outcomes**: By the end of Phase 3, participants should be able to:
- Independently facilitate family interventions across multiple modes
- Navigate ethical dilemmas with confidence and accountability
- Demonstrate competency across all Core Values Interventionist learning objectives

---

**Mentorship Expectations & Commitment (10 minutes)**

Clarify what participants are committing to:

**Time Commitment:**
- **Weeks 1–12**: 2–3 hours per week (supervision + observation + documentation)
- **Weeks 13–28**: 3–5 hours per week (supervision + co-facilitation + consultation)
- **Weeks 29–40**: 2–4 hours per week (supervision + independent practice + documentation)

**Financial Commitment:**
- Mentorship fees (if applicable—clarify based on program structure)
- Continuing education and advanced training costs

**Professional Commitment:**
- Maintain ethical standards and Core Values Code of Ethics
- Complete all required documentation and case reviews
- Participate actively in supervision and peer learning

**Personal Commitment:**
- Self-care and boundary management
- Ongoing learning and skill development
- Accountability to clients, families, and the Core Values community

---

**Reflection: Preparing for Mentorship (5 minutes)**

Guide participants through the workbook reflection prompts:

1. **My availability for mentorship (weekly commitment):**
   - "What days and times can you commit to supervision calls and practice?"

2. **Learning goals for mentorship:**
   - "What do you want to develop during the 40 weeks?"

3. **Questions about mentorship program:**
   - "What clarifications do you need?"

4. **Support I'll need to complete mentorship:**
   - "What resources, accountability, or support will help you succeed?"

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share their learning goals or questions aloud.

---

**Closing the Session (2 minutes)**

> "The mentorship program is designed to support you—not to overwhelm you. You will not be alone in this work. You will have a mentor, a peer cohort, and access to resources. The goal is to help you build a sustainable, ethical, and effective intervention practice—one case at a time."

---

### Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Choice**: Participants should not feel pressured to commit to mentorship if they are not ready. Normalize the decision to wait or pursue other pathways.
- **Transparency**: Be clear about time, financial, and professional commitments. No surprises.
- **Empowerment**: Frame mentorship as an investment in their professional growth, not a requirement they "have to" complete.

---

## Session 3.6: Integration & Closing Ceremony (3:35–4:45 PM)

### Purpose

The final session of the training is about **integration, closure, and celebration**. Participants will synthesize their learning from the full 3-day experience, articulate their commitments to the work, and participate in a ceremonial closing that honors the journey they've taken together.

This session is designed to be reflective, emotional, and inspiring—sending participants into the world with clarity, confidence, and connection.

---

### Why This Matters

Endings matter. How we close a learning experience shapes what participants carry forward. The closing ceremony provides:

- **Closure**: A clear transition from training to practice
- **Integration**: Space to make meaning of the full 3-day experience
- **Commitment**: An opportunity to name intentions and accountability
- **Celebration**: Recognition of the courage, growth, and effort participants have shown
- **Connection**: A reminder that they are part of a community of practitioners

---

### Facilitation Guide

**Part 1: Letter to My Future Self (20 minutes)**

**Opening (3 minutes)**

> "You've spent three days learning, practicing, reflecting, and growing. You've built awareness of systems, learned how to coordinate care, and practiced intervention facilitation. Now, we're going to take time to integrate what you've learned by writing a letter to your future self."

Explain the purpose:

> "Six months from now, you'll be midway through your mentorship. You'll have facilitated interventions, encountered challenges, and grown in ways you can't yet imagine. This letter is a way to remind your future self what you learned here—what mattered, what you committed to, and what you hope to become."

---

**Reflection Prompts (15 minutes)**

Guide participants through the workbook prompts:

**1. Dear Future Me,**

> "Write to yourself six months from now. What do you want to remember from these 3 days? What commitments are you making? What hopes do you have for your development as an interventionist?"

Examples to spark reflection:

- "I hope you remember that intervention is about connection, not control."
- "I hope you've been kind to yourself when things didn't go as planned."
- "I hope you've stayed curious and asked for help when you needed it."
- "I hope you're still honoring the trust families place in you."

**2. Signed,**
**3. Today's date:**

Encourage participants to write from the heart—this is for them, not for anyone else.

Optional: Facilitators can collect these letters, seal them in envelopes, and mail them to participants at the 6-month mark as a surprise reminder.

---

**Part 2: Circle Closing Reflections (30 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "Now we're going to come together as a group for a closing circle. This is a time to share what you're taking with you, to name your commitments, and to express gratitude."

Arrange chairs in a circle if possible. This physical arrangement reinforces connection and equality.

---

**Round 1: What I'm taking with me (10 minutes)**

Invite each participant to share one thing they are taking with them from the training. Use the prompt:

> "What is one skill, insight, or connection you're taking forward?"

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly (1–2 minutes each).

Examples participants might name:

- "I'm taking the reminder that I don't have to have all the answers."
- "I'm taking the opening script I practiced today—I'll use that in my first intervention."
- "I'm taking the connection I feel with this group—it's powerful to not be alone in this work."

Facilitator note: Do not allow anyone to skip their turn. Gentle encouragement: "Take your time. What's one thing—even small—that shifted for you?"

---

**MICRO-BREAK (5 minutes — ~4:15 PM)**

> "Let's take a 5-minute break to stand, stretch, and reset before we continue."

---

**Round 2: My commitment to the families I'll serve (10 minutes)**

Invite each participant to share their commitment. Use the prompt:

> "How will you show up as an interventionist? What promise are you making to the families you'll serve?"

Examples:

- "I commit to showing up with humility, knowing that I don't have all the answers."
- "I commit to creating safety in every intervention—no coercion, only invitation."
- "I commit to ongoing learning and seeking supervision when I need it."
- "I commit to honoring the dignity of every person I serve, even when they say no."

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly.

---

**Round 3: Gratitude (8 minutes)**

Close the circle with gratitude. Invite each participant to express appreciation—for the group, for the facilitators, for the experience.

Examples:

- "I'm grateful for the vulnerability everyone brought to the roleplays—I learned so much from watching you."
- "I'm grateful for the facilitators' patience and wisdom."
- "I'm grateful for the reminder that I'm not alone in this work."

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly.

---

**Part 3: Ceremonial Closing (10 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "You've completed the Core Values Interventionist Training. You've learned the philosophy, practiced the skills, and built the foundation for your work as a guide for families in crisis. This is not the end—it's the beginning."

---

**Certificate Distribution (3 minutes)**

Distribute **Certificates of Completion** to each participant. Call each person by name and invite them to stand as they receive their certificate.

Optional: Take a group photo with certificates.

---

**Closing Blessing or Affirmation (5 minutes)**

Offer a closing blessing or affirmation that honors the work participants are stepping into:

> "May you intervene with compassion, guide with humility, and trust the process of connection. May you see systems, not symptoms. May you invite rather than coerce. May you coordinate care ethically and serve families with integrity. May you remember that intervention is not about perfection—it is about presence, courage, and care."

Pause.

> "You are ready. Not because you know everything, but because you are committed to learning. Welcome to the work."

---

**Final Goodbyes & Logistics (4:45–5:00 PM)**

**Logistics (10 minutes)**

Provide final reminders and next steps:

1. **Certificates**: Ensure everyone has received their certificate
2. **Contact Exchange**: Encourage participants to exchange contact information with cohort members
3. **Next Steps**: Explain how mentorship enrollment works and when first calls will be scheduled
4. **Resources**: Provide access information for:
   - Digital workbook download
   - Core Values tools reference
   - Mentorship program materials
   - Community platform (if applicable)

**Workbook Reflection: Action Items (5 minutes)**

Before participants leave, ask them to complete the final workbook prompt:

> "What are your action items before your first mentorship call?"

Examples:

- Schedule first supervision call with mentor
- Review intervention case studies from training
- Prepare first case for consultation
- Set up self-care routines

---

**Final Goodbye (2 minutes)**

> "Thank you for your commitment, your vulnerability, and your courage. You are part of the Core Values community now. You are not alone. Go forth and serve families with compassion and care."

Close with applause, hugs, or whatever feels appropriate for the group culture.

---

## Day 3 Reflection: Final Integration

### Purpose

The final reflection is a comprehensive integration exercise that helps participants synthesize the full 3-day training experience. This is completed individually, either at the end of Day 3 or as homework before the first mentorship call.

---

### Reflection Prompts

**1. Most powerful moment from Day 3:**
- "What moved me or shifted my understanding today?"

**2. What the role-plays taught me about myself:**
- "What strengths, growing edges, or patterns did I notice?"

**3. One skill I'm confident in:**
- "What do I know I can do well?"

**4. One skill I'll prioritize developing:**
- "What do I most need to practice?"

**5. How I'll integrate trauma-informed care:**
- "What practices will I bring to intervention work?"

**6. My ethical 'north star' as an interventionist:**
- "What core principles will guide me?"

**7. What I'm looking forward to in mentorship:**
- "What opportunities, challenges, or growth am I excited about?"

**8. My biggest learning from the full 3-day training:**
- "What will stay with me from this experience?"

**9. One word that captures my journey:**
- "What word sums up these three days?"

---

## Facilitator Self-Care After Day 3

### Facilitator Debrief

After participants leave, facilitators should take time to debrief together. Day 3 is emotionally demanding for facilitators as well—holding space for vulnerable practice, managing group dynamics, and providing feedback requires significant energy.

**Debrief Prompts:**

- What went well today?
- What was challenging?
- Were there any participants we need to follow up with?
- What would we do differently next time?
- How are we feeling?

**Facilitator Self-Care:**

- Take time to rest and recover before the next training
- Seek peer consultation if anything felt ethically complex
- Celebrate the work—facilitating intervention training is sacred work

---

## Trauma-Informed Training: A Meta-Reflection

This training is designed to **model** trauma-informed care at every level. Facilitators are not just teaching trauma-informed principles—they are embodying them. This means:

- **Safety**: Creating a container where participants can be vulnerable without fear of judgment
- **Trustworthiness**: Following through on commitments, honoring boundaries, maintaining confidentiality
- **Choice**: Offering options, never forcing participation, respecting autonomy
- **Collaboration**: Learning together, not hierarchically—facilitators are guides, not gurus
- **Empowerment**: Naming strengths, building confidence, affirming courage

If participants leave Day 3 feeling seen, supported, and capable—even if they also feel challenged and uncertain—you have succeeded.
