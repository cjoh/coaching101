# Section 4: Impact Letters Lab

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

Impact Letters are both an intervention tool and a relational repair practice. This section provides detailed guidance for coaching families through the writing process.

## Six-Part Structure (With Coaching Prompts)

1. **Opening (Love):** "I love you and I am writing this because…"
   - Prompt: Ask the writer to anchor in shared memories or values.
2. **Specific Observations (Observation):** "I've noticed…"
   - Prompt: Use dates, behaviors, and neutral descriptions; avoid diagnoses.
3. **Personal Impact (Impact):** "This has affected me by…"
   - Prompt: Encourage naming feelings and consequences without blame.
4. **Concern (Concern):** "I'm worried that…"
   - Prompt: Connect observations to risks (health, relationships, safety).
5. **Hope (Hope):** "I believe you can…"
   - Prompt: Highlight strengths and past successes; invite possibility.
6. **Request (Request):** "I'm asking you to consider…"
   - Prompt: Align requests with researched treatment options; offer practical support.

## Facilitating the Writing Process

- **Timeline:** Allocate at least one week between draft one and final rehearsal.
- **Coaching Touchpoints:** Schedule two review calls per letter—first for content alignment, second for tone and delivery.
- **Delivery Practice:** During rehearsals, have writers speak slowly, breathe between sections, and maintain eye contact.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Avoid ultimatums, sarcasm, or mixed messages ("You can stay if…"); revise any statements that undermine autonomy.

## Documentation Checklist

- Save final letters in encrypted case files.
- Record who will read in the live meeting and in what sequence.
- Note any letters that will be delivered privately to maintain safety.
