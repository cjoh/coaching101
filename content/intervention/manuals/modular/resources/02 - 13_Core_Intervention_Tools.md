# Section 1: 13 Core Intervention Tools

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Overview

The Core Values intervention toolkit is organized into thirteen interventions that span preparation, live facilitation, and continuing care. The first five tools are practiced intensively during Day 2 (Session 2.4) and form the baseline competencies for all interventionists. The remaining eight are introduced during mentorship and expand your capacity to lead complex cases.

## Five Essential Tools (Day 2 Intensive)

Each essential tool is practiced through hands-on exercises. Mastery requires fluency in purpose, structure, and adaptive use.

### 1. Impact Letters

- **Purpose:** Give family members a structured way to communicate love, concerns, and requests without shaming the Pivot Person.
- **Core Practices:** Follow the six-part structure (Love, Observation, Impact, Concern, Hope, Request); rehearse delivery; align letters to treatment invitation.
- **Use During Intervention:** Anchor the family meeting; offer clarity when emotions run high; provide written material the Pivot Person can revisit.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Letters are specific, compassionate, and end with a clear invitation; the facilitator can coach edits without rewriting the family's voice.

### 2. Safety Planning

- **Purpose:** Ensure immediate physical and psychological safety for the Pivot Person and participating family members.
- **Core Practices:** Screen for medical, suicide, violence, overdose, and withdrawal risks; build layered response plans; document who holds each action.
- **Use During Intervention:** Prior to in-person meetings, during crisis response, and when reassessing risk post-intervention.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Up-to-date safety plan stored with the case file; contingency partners briefed and reachable; interventionist knows how to escalate to emergency services.

### 3. Motivational Interviewing (MI)

- **Purpose:** Increase intrinsic motivation for change by listening reflectively and evoking the Pivot Person's own reasons to act.
- **Core Practices:** Use the OARS framework (Open questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries); respond to sustain talk without argument.
- **Use During Intervention:** In one-on-one conversations with the Pivot Person, during family coaching sessions, and when debriefing post-intervention.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Facilitator can surface change talk, avoid righting reflex, and summarize statements that highlight autonomy and hope.

### 4. Family Meeting Facilitation

- **Purpose:** Guide the live intervention meeting (or series of meetings) with structure, emotional containment, and actionable outcomes.
- **Core Practices:** Establish opening agreements, manage conflict, maintain focus on shared goals, and close with commitments and next steps.
- **Use During Intervention:** Central activity of Modes 1–4; also useful for ongoing family accountability meetings.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Meetings stay within agreed time, each participant is heard, action steps are captured, and the Pivot Person leaves with clarity about supports.

### 5. Treatment Options Research

- **Purpose:** Present viable treatment pathways aligned with clinical needs, insurance realities, cultural fit, and family resources.
- **Core Practices:** Vet providers across the continuum of care (Detox, Residential, PHP, IOP, Outpatient, Sober Living); confirm admission criteria; plan logistics.
- **Use During Intervention:** Before formal invitation to ensure immediate placement; during family coaching to expand knowledge.
- **Evidence of Mastery:** Interventionist prepares at least three aligned options with financial estimates, travel plans, and warm hand-offs to receiving providers.

## Eight Additional Tools (Mentorship Expansion)

Introduced and refined across the 40-week mentorship. These tools deepen your capacity to design engagements, rehearse execution, and sustain post-treatment momentum.

### 6. Planning & Running Meetings

- **Focus:** Architect multi-stage planning meetings with families and collaborators; build agendas that clarify purpose, process, and follow-up.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 1–8 with supervision on agenda design; practice adjusting cadence based on family readiness.

### 7. Intervention Rehearsals

- **Focus:** Conduct mock interventions so participants can practice reading letters, regulating emotions, and navigating objections.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 5–16; mentor observes at least one rehearsal and delivers coaching on tone, pacing, and language.

### 8. Aftercare Support

- **Focus:** Design sustained recovery plans that include clinical, community, and family supports beyond initial treatment.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 13–28; integrate relapse-prevention strategies, healthy choice agreements, and accountability measures.

### 9. Core Values Recovery Model

- **Focus:** Blend family coaching, individual coaching, and case management into a unified care map; ensure services reinforce the four Core Values.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 9–40; case presentations emphasize how supports align with dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility.

### 10. Recovery Meetings (12-Step, etc.)

- **Focus:** Connect families and the Pivot Person to peer-led communities (AA, NA, Al-Anon, SMART Recovery, etc.) that offer ongoing accountability.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 9–24; build scripts for invitations, transportation plans, and relapse response protocols.

### 11. Accountability Monitoring

- **Focus:** Incorporate breathalyzers, drug testing, and other verification tools ethically and in partnership with the family.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 13–32; evaluate when monitoring supports growth versus when it becomes punitive.

### 12. Emergency Response

- **Focus:** Activate rapid-response pathways for overdose, relapse, self-harm, or violence; coordinate with medical and legal professionals.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 1–40; simulation drills ensure interventionists can lead de-escalation while maintaining their own safety.

### 13. One-on-One Support

- **Focus:** Provide individual sessions to the Pivot Person or family members when group convenings are not possible.
- **Mentorship Target:** Weeks 17–40; integrate MI, solution-focused coaching, and safety assessments in every touchpoint.

## 5-Mode Intervention Continuum

The thirteen tools are deployed across five intervention modes. Selecting the right mode ensures proper pacing and containment.

| Mode | Primary Conditions | Tool Emphasis | Interventionist Focus |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Mode 1: Collaborative | Pivot Person is willing and engaged | Family Meeting Facilitation, MI, Treatment Research | Co-create plans, amplify intrinsic motivation |
| Mode 2: Structured | Pivot Person is ambivalent or inconsistent | Impact Letters, Rehearsals, Planning Meetings | Increase clarity, strengthen family alignment |
| Mode 3: Planned | Pivot Person is resistant; significant risk indicators | Safety Planning, Emergency Response, Accountability Monitoring | Manage risk, coordinate decisive invitations |
| Mode 4: Crisis | Immediate safety threats require rapid action | Emergency Response, Safety Planning, One-on-One Support | Protect life and stabilize; involve authorities as needed |
| Mode 5: Individual | Family unavailable or unsafe | One-on-One Support, MI, Aftercare Support | Build alliance with Pivot Person, coordinate external supports |

> **Application Tip:** Before launching any intervention activity, clarify the current mode with your supervising mentor. Modes can shift mid-case—document transitions and adjust tools accordingly.
