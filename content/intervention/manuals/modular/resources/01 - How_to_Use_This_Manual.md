# How to Use This Manual

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

This manual translates the Resources & Quick Reference library into a comprehensive guide you can use before, during, and after intervention assignments. Keep it alongside the Day 1–3 manuals to anchor your practice in shared language, essential tools, and ongoing development pathways.

- **Before an intervention:** Use the assessment, language, and tool primers to prepare families and collaborators.
- **During live work:** Reference the checklists, scripts, and mentoring notes to stay grounded in values-based intervention.
- **After each case:** Document your learning, schedule mentorship touchpoints, and update your resource map.

> **Practice reminder:** When in doubt, return to the Core Values—dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility—then select the tool or resource that helps you express those values in action.
