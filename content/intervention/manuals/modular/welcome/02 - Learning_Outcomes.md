## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this training, you will be able to demonstrate competency in the following areas:

### 1. Define and Describe the Core Values Model of Intervention

You will articulate the philosophy, values, and practices that distinguish Core Values intervention from other approaches. This includes understanding intervention as a **process of connection** rather than confrontation, and recognizing that recovery is lifelong and belongs to the whole family system.

**Example**: You will be able to explain to a family why we use the term "Pivot Person" instead of "addict" or "person of concern," and how language shapes dignity and hope in the intervention process.

---

### 2. Identify Distinctions and Overlaps Between Professional Roles

You will clearly differentiate the roles of Interventionists, Coaches, Therapists, Sponsors, and Peer Professionals—understanding where these roles overlap and where they diverge. This clarity prevents role confusion and ensures ethical, effective collaboration.

**Example**: You will know when a family needs clinical therapy (trauma processing, diagnosis) versus coaching (accountability, goal-setting) versus peer support (shared experience, connection)—and how to coordinate all three without overstepping your scope.

---

### 3. Apply Systems Theory to Intervention

You will understand how family systems operate—recognizing patterns of communication, power dynamics, triangulation, enabling, and resilience. You will see how individual behavior is shaped by relationships and how recovery requires systemic change, not just individual willpower.

**Example**: In a case study, you will identify how a mother's overprotection, a father's detachment, and a sibling's resentment all contribute to the Pivot Person's resistance to help—and you will design interventions that address the system, not just the individual.

---

### 4. Demonstrate Ethical Alignment with the Core Values Code of Ethics

You will embody the principles of **Integrity, Humility, Service, and Connection** in all aspects of your work. This includes maintaining boundaries, avoiding conflicts of interest, honoring confidentiality, and always prioritizing the family's wellbeing over financial gain.

**Example**: You will recognize when a treatment center offers you a referral fee—and you will decline, explaining to the family why your independence is essential to their trust and your effectiveness.

---

### 5. Develop Coordinated Intervention Plans

You will create comprehensive, personalized intervention plans that honor dignity, invitation, and connection. These plans will include assessment of the family system, identification of care team members, communication strategies, and contingency planning for multiple outcomes.

**Example**: You will design an intervention plan that includes a family meeting script, roles for each participant, connection to detox and outpatient services, coordination with the Pivot Person's therapist, and a follow-up plan for ongoing family coaching—all without assuming the Pivot Person will say "yes" immediately.

---

### 6. Facilitate Family Communication

You will guide families through difficult conversations with skill, compassion, and structure. This includes managing emotions, de-escalating conflict, reframing blame into accountability, and creating space for honest expression without coercion.

**Example**: When a family member says, "If you loved us, you'd just stop using," you will gently redirect toward values-based language: "What I hear is that you feel afraid and disconnected. Let's talk about what connection and safety would look like for everyone."

---

### 7. Collaborate Effectively with Multidisciplinary Teams

You will build and coordinate care networks that include therapists, coaches, medical professionals, peer support specialists, and family members. You will use shared language, respect professional boundaries, and ensure everyone is working toward aligned goals.

**Example**: You will schedule a care team meeting with the Pivot Person's therapist, recovery coach, and family doctor—facilitating a conversation about medication-assisted treatment, trauma-informed therapy, and family coaching without overstepping into clinical decision-making.

---

### 8. Integrate Core Values Language in Communication

You will use the specific terminology of the Core Values Recovery system in all your work—language that reframes shame into dignity, blame into accountability, and coercion into invitation. This includes terms like "Pivot Person," "Healthy Choices," and "Recovery is a Team Sport."

**Example**: Instead of saying, "Your son needs to set boundaries with his drug-using friends," you will say, "Your son is learning to make Healthy Choices about who he spends time with—and the family can support that by modeling connection and respect."

---

### 9. Lead Structured Family Case Studies

You will facilitate group discussions and reflections using real-world case studies. This includes presenting scenarios, eliciting participant insights, guiding ethical analysis, and helping others learn from both successes and failures.

**Example**: During the training, you will present a case study of a failed intervention—analyzing what went wrong, what could have been done differently, and what lessons the group can apply to their own practice.

---

### 10. Prepare for 40-Week Mentorship

You will understand the structure, expectations, and commitments of the 40-week mentorship program that follows this training. This includes clarity on supervision requirements, case consultations, ethical accountability, and the path toward Core Values Interventionist certification.

**Example**: You will know that mentorship includes monthly one-on-one supervision, quarterly group case reviews, and documentation of at least 10 intervention cases—and you will be able to articulate why this ongoing support is essential to competent, ethical practice.
