## Training Structure

### The 3-Day Journey

The Core Values Interventionist Training unfolds over three days, each building on the last:

#### **Day 1: Awareness — The Foundation of Connection**

**Duration**: 7 hours
**Focus**: What is intervention? Who we serve? How we see systems?

On Day 1, you will explore the philosophical foundations of Core Values intervention. You will learn to see families as **systems**, not collections of individuals. You will examine your own biases, assumptions, and recovery story—and how they shape your practice. You will begin to build the awareness necessary to hold complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty with grace.

**Key Topics**:
- Defining intervention as connection
- Systems theory and family dynamics
- The role of the interventionist
- Self-awareness and bias recognition
- Language and dignity in recovery work

---

#### **Day 2: Coordination — The Architecture of Care**

**Duration**: 7 hours
**Focus**: Building care networks and understanding professional boundaries

On Day 2, you will learn the practical work of coordinating care. You will explore the distinctions between interventionists, coaches, therapists, sponsors, and peer professionals—and how to collaborate effectively across disciplines. You will examine ethical dilemmas, financial conflicts of interest, and boundary violations that compromise intervention work.

**Key Topics**:
- Multidisciplinary collaboration
- Ethical boundaries and scope of practice
- Financial independence and conflicts of interest
- Care team coordination
- Communication strategies for professionals

#### **Day 3: Care — Practice & Integration**

**Duration**: 7 hours
**Focus**: Live practice, group reflection, mentorship preparation

On Day 3, you will practice what you have learned. Through live roleplays, case consultations, and group reflection, you will apply Core Values principles to real-world scenarios. You will facilitate family meetings, navigate ethical gray areas, and receive feedback from peers and facilitators. You will also prepare for the 40-week mentorship program that follows the training.

**Key Topics**:
- Live intervention practice
- Case study facilitation
- Ethical decision-making in gray areas
