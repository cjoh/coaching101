### Reflection Exercises

Throughout the workbook, you will encounter **reflection prompts** designed to help you integrate what you are learning with your own experience, values, and professional identity. These prompts will ask you to:

- Explore your own recovery story and how it informs your work
- Identify your strengths and areas for growth as an interventionist
- Analyze case studies and apply Core Values principles
- Reflect on ethical dilemmas and gray-area decisions

**Type your responses directly into the text fields provided.** Your work is automatically saved as you type, so you do not need to worry about losing your progress. Be honest, thorough, and vulnerable in your reflections—this is your space to learn, not to perform.

### Saving Your Progress

Your responses are **automatically saved** to your browser's local storage as you type. This means:

- You can close the workbook and return later without losing your work
- Your responses are private and stored only on your device

**Important**: If you clear your browser's cache or use a different device, your responses will not be synced. We recommend exporting your workbook periodically as a backup.

### Getting the Most from This Training

This training is intensive, immersive, and emotionally demanding. To get the most from the experience:

- **Be present**: Turn off distractions, engage fully in activities, and commit to the process
- **Be vulnerable**: Share your own stories, struggles, and uncertainties—this is how we learn together
- **Be curious**: Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and stay open to new perspectives
- **Be compassionate**: Treat yourself and others with kindness, especially when the work feels hard
- **Be accountable**: Follow through on commitments, show up prepared, and take responsibility for your learning

Recovery work is sacred work. Intervention work is sacred work. You are stepping into families' most vulnerable moments. Honor that by showing up with your whole self—imperfect, uncertain, and committed to growth.
