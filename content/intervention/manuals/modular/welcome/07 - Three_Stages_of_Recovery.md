# The Three Stages of Recovery
## A Framework for Meeting Clients Where They Are

---

## Overview

Recovery is not a single event—it's a progression of awareness, stabilization, and growth that unfolds over time. By breaking the process into three distinct phases—**Landing, Stabilization, and Optimization**—we give both the Pivot Person and their family a clear map of where they are and what comes next.

This framework helps interventionists and coaches:
- **Normalize the recovery journey** - Reduce shame by naming common patterns
- **Adjust support appropriately** - Meet families with what they need at each stage
- **Recognize progress signals** - Identify indicators of growth and relapse risk
- **Communicate with compassion** - Offer hope while validating current reality

---

## Why This Framework Matters

Families often enter the intervention process in chaos, not recognizing the patterns that have shaped their responses. By naming each phase and describing what's happening within it, we create language that transforms confusion into understanding.

When an interventionist can gently reflect, *"This is the stage your family is in,"* it brings:
- **Relief** - Validation that their experience is normal
- **Direction** - A sense of pathway forward
- **Hope** - Confidence that this stage has a next phase

The three-stage model isn't meant to label or grade a family—it's meant to **show them where they are** so they can move forward with awareness.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Framework Applies to Both Pivot Person AND Family
Recovery is a family journey. While the Pivot Person may be in Stabilization, family members might still be Landing in their own process. Recognize each person's stage independently.

### 2. Stages Are Not Linear
Recovery doesn't follow a perfect timeline. Families may move between stages, regress during crisis, or progress at different rates. This framework describes patterns, not prescriptions.

### 3. Use This Framework as a Mirror, Not a Map
We reflect what we see without diagnosing: *"What you're describing sounds like Landing—everything feels uncertain right now. That's normal."*

We don't impose: *"You should be in Stabilization by now."*

### 4. Each Stage Has Signals of Progress and Relapse
Understanding indicators helps interventionists recognize when support is working and when additional resources are needed.

## STAGE 1: Landing (Acceptance)

### What's Happening

In the Landing phase, the Pivot Person is coming to terms with the reality of their condition and beginning to accept help. The family often experiences equal turbulence—relief that change is beginning mixed with anxiety about what it means.

This is when **emotional containment and clear boundaries** are most needed from the family system.

### The Pivot Person's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| Acceptance of disease as reality |
| Physical withdrawal and detox |
| White-knuckling through early sobriety |
| Denial, anger, bargaining |
| Entering treatment (residential, IOP, PHP) |
| Beginning to accept intervention |
| Monitoring and accountability structures |

### The Family's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| Confrontation of the disease reality |
| Acceptance of their own role and responsibility |
| Shock, anger, shame, denial |
| Transition from enabling to establishing healthy choices |
| Seeking external help and professional guidance |
| Learning new language and frameworks |
| High anxiety and hypervigilance |

### Relapse Signals (Probability: 75-85% - High Risk)

**For the Pivot Person:**
- Lack of acceptance or minimizing severity
- Leaving treatment AMA (against medical advice)
- Compartmentalizing (separating family from recovery program)
- Not accepting intervention or outside help
- "I can do it on my own" / "I got this" mentality

**For the Family:**
- Doubting or undermining professional help
- Attempting to control Pivot Person's recovery
- Reverting to denial when things improve
- Secret enabling behaviors
- Power gatekeeping (controlling access to resources or information)

### What Transition to Stabilization Looks Like

**For the Pivot Person:**
- ✅ Acceptance of disease as a fact
- ✅ Surrender (doing what is asked without resistance)
- ✅ Reduction in game-playing and manipulation
- ✅ Establishing home group and sponsor relationship
- ✅ Regular meeting attendance (90-in-90)

**For the Family:**
- ✅ Willingness to work with outside professionals
- ✅ Willingness to work as a team
- ✅ Have independent resources (Al-Anon, therapy, coaching)
- ✅ Reduction in enablement patterns
- ✅ Reduction in resentment and blame

### Interventionist's Role During Landing

**Primary Focus:** Emotional stabilization, safety planning, connection to resources

**What Families Need:**
- Clear information about addiction and recovery
- Help establishing boundaries without shame
- Connection to Al-Anon, family coaching, or support groups
- Permission to focus on their own recovery
- Reassurance that crisis is the beginning, not the end

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What does safety look like for you right now?"
- "Who else needs support in this moment?"
- "What do you need to let go of that you've been carrying?"

## STAGE 2: Stabilization

### What's Happening

During Stabilization, the Pivot Person is developing consistency—attending meetings, engaging in step work, and building accountability structures. This is the phase of learning new rhythms and rebuilding trust.

For the family, it's about **recalibrating roles and expectations**, supporting autonomy, and letting the Pivot Person take responsibility for their own growth without micromanaging.

### The Pivot Person's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| "I will not drink today" mindset |
| Active step work and 90-in-90 commitment |
| Sober living, PHP, or IOP participation |
| Peer support and sponsorship engagement |
| Regular therapy and/or MAT (medication-assisted treatment) |
| Taking service positions in recovery community |
| Submitting to monitoring and accountability |

### The Family's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| Relaxing from crisis mode |
| Adjustment to "new normal" |
| Attendance at family programs (Al-Anon, family coaching) |
| Practicing detachment with love |
| Consistency in communication |
| Accountability replaces emotional rescue |

### Relapse Signals (Probability: 60-70% - Elevated Risk)

**For the Pivot Person:**
- Lack of follow-through on commitments
- Isolating from support network
- Skipping meetings or therapy
- Resentment toward accountability
- "I've got this now" overconfidence

**For the Family:**
- "Things are fixed now" disengagement
- Minimizing ongoing risk of relapse
- Slipping back into comfortable roles (caretaker, enforcer, victim)
- Return to enablement patterns
- Avoiding uncomfortable conversations

### What Transition to Optimization Looks Like

**For the Pivot Person:**
- ✅ Consistent follow-through on commitments
- ✅ Spiritual practice becoming natural
- ✅ Shift from obligation to privilege mindset
- ✅ Completion of 12 steps (first time through)
- ✅ Improved emotional regulation

**For the Family:**
- ✅ Consistent healthy choices without drama
- ✅ Safe, calm, predictable household environment
- ✅ Shared growth and purpose emerging
- ✅ Pivot person is less of a primary focus
- ✅ Appreciation of new normal (not just tolerance)

### Interventionist's Role During Stabilization

**Primary Focus:** Supporting consistency, reinforcing progress, addressing setbacks compassionately

**What Families Need:**
- Help recognizing and celebrating progress
- Tools for healthy communication
- Support navigating setbacks without panic
- Encouragement to maintain their own recovery work
- Realistic expectations about timeline

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What progress have you noticed this week?"
- "How are you caring for yourself in this new rhythm?"
- "What fears are coming up as things stabilize?"

## STAGE 3: Optimization

### What's Happening

In Optimization, the Pivot Person is achieving **emotional stability and reintegration**—aligning recovery with career, purpose, and relationships. This is a phase of maintenance, leadership, and meaning.

For the family, the work deepens: it's about **sustaining connection without dependence**, fostering mutual growth, and continuing to model healthy individuality and unity.

### The Pivot Person's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| Emotional sobriety (not just physical) |
| Integration with career and purpose |
| Sponsorship and service leadership |
| Recovery as privilege, not obligation |
| Active maintenance and vigilance |
| Long-term relationships and accountability |

### The Family's Experience

| What It Looks Like |
|-------------------|
| Healthy patterns of communication normalized |
| Protection has shifted to partnership |
| Family works on their own growth (not just Pivot Person's) |
| Focus moves to shared values and contribution |
| Thriving rather than merely surviving |

### Relapse Signals (Probability: 20-40%, reducing over time - Reduced Risk)

**For the Pivot Person:**
- Stagnation in recovery (no growth or service)
- Lack of integration with career or purpose
- Secret-keeping behaviors returning
- Separation from recovery program
- Loss of routine and structure
- Assuming recovery is permanent and invincible

**For the Family:**
- Assuming recovery is permanent and complete
- Neglecting family self-care
- Failing to process lingering wounds
- Loss of shared routines
- Return to obligation-based behavior
- Emotional distance replacing connection

### Interventionist's Role During Optimization

**Primary Focus:** Celebrating integration, sustaining connection, modeling thriving

**What Families Need:**
- Permission to focus on their own dreams and goals
- Help processing grief and lingering trauma
- Encouragement to maintain recovery practices
- Realistic perspective on long-term maintenance
- Vision for what thriving (not just surviving) looks like

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What does thriving look like for your family?"
- "How are you growing individually and together?"
- "What unfinished business needs attention?"

## Using the Framework in Practice

### Reflecting Stages Without Diagnosing

**Instead of:**
- "You're clearly in the Landing stage."
- "Your family needs to move to Stabilization."

**Try:**
- "What you're describing sounds a lot like Landing—everything feels uncertain and urgent right now. That's a normal beginning place."
- "It seems your family is entering Stabilization—you're building consistency, and trust is starting to return."

### Normalizing the Journey

Use the framework to **reduce shame** and **offer hope**:

*"Many families experience what you're going through right now. It's part of the Landing process. The good news is, as you keep showing up and doing the work, Stabilization comes. You're not stuck here forever."*

### Adjusting Your Approach by Stage

| Stage | What Families Need Most | Interventionist Stance |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Landing** | Information, safety, boundaries, hope | Stabilizing, directive, resourceful |
| **Stabilization** | Encouragement, skill-building, patience | Coaching, curious, celebratory |
| **Optimization** | Vision, integration, maintenance | Empowering, reflective, visionary |

## Integration with Other Core Values Frameworks

### The Three Stages + The GROW Model

- **Landing:** Focus on **Reality** (where are we now?) and **Goal** (what does safety look like?)
- **Stabilization:** Focus on **Options** (what tools are available?) and **Will** (what commitments can we make?)
- **Optimization:** Focus on **Goal** (what does thriving look like?) and **Will** (how do we sustain this?)

### The Three Stages + Circle of Control

- **Landing:** Help families distinguish what they can and cannot control
- **Stabilization:** Practice making choices within their control
- **Optimization:** Expand influence through service and leadership

### The Three Stages + Recovery Pathways

Remember: The three stages apply regardless of which pathway the Pivot Person chooses (12-step, SMART, faith-based, MAT, harm reduction). Stages describe the journey, not the method.
