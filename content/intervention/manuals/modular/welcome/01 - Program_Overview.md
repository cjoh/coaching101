# Welcome to Core Values Interventionist Training

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Program Overview

Welcome to the **Core Values Interventionist Training**—a transformative 3-day immersive program designed to prepare you to guide families from crisis to connection. This training equips you with the knowledge, skills, and ethical framework to serve as a professional interventionist who sees systems, builds collaboration, and honors the dignity of every person touched by addiction and recovery.

### What Is This Training?

This is an advanced professional training for individuals with recovery experience and professional backgrounds in coaching, therapy, or peer support. Over three intensive days, you will learn the Core Values model of intervention—a philosophy and practice that views intervention not as a confrontation, but as a **guided process of connection** that brings together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move from crisis to recovery.

Unlike traditional intervention models that focus on coercion or control, Core Values intervention is rooted in **invitation, collaboration, and dignity**. You will learn to work with entire family systems, coordinate multidisciplinary care teams, and facilitate communication that honors the humanity of everyone involved.

### Who Is This Training For?

This training is designed for:

- **Recovery coaches** seeking to expand their practice to family intervention work
- **Therapists and counselors** who want to incorporate intervention coordination into their clinical work
- **Peer support professionals** with lived experience who are ready to serve families in crisis
- **Experienced practitioners** looking to deepen their understanding of systems-based intervention
- **Anyone committed to ethical, family-centered care** in the recovery space

**Prerequisites**: Participants should have recovery experience (personal or professional), a foundational understanding of addiction and recovery, and a commitment to practicing within ethical boundaries.

### What Makes This Training Different

The Core Values approach to intervention stands apart from traditional models in several key ways:

#### **See Systems, Not Symptoms**

We recognize that addiction impacts entire family systems, not just the individual struggling with substance use. Recovery belongs to the whole family. As an interventionist, you will learn to see the interconnections, patterns, and relationships that shape crisis and recovery—and to work with families as collaborative partners, not passive recipients of your expertise.

#### **Invite Rather Than Coerce**

Traditional intervention often relies on ultimatums, pressure, and confrontation. Core Values intervention is built on **invitation and connection**. You will learn to create conditions where change becomes possible through dignity, respect, and honest communication—not through manipulation or control.

#### **Coordinate Care Ethically**

Professional interventionists serve as **care coordinators** who bring together multidisciplinary teams (therapists, coaches, medical professionals, peer support, family members) to create comprehensive recovery plans. Critically, Core Values interventionists maintain **ethical independence**—we have no financial interest in treatment placements or outcomes. Your loyalty is to the family, not to referral fees.

#### **Practice Adaptive Intervention**

There is no formula. Every family requires a personalized path. You will learn to meet families where they are, adapt your approach based on what they need, and remain flexible as circumstances change. Intervention is not a script—it is a dynamic, responsive practice grounded in awareness, coordination, and care.
