## Section 2.1: Professional Boundaries & Ethics

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Core Value:** Integrity through clear boundaries

### Why This Matters

As an interventionist, you'll work at the intersection of family systems, clinical care, and crisis response. Clear boundaries aren't restrictive—they're protective. They allow you to serve families powerfully without overextending, taking on inappropriate responsibility, or creating confusion about your role.

### 2.1A: The Interventionist's Scope of Practice

**What Interventionists DO:**

- **Facilitate family meetings** to express concern and offer treatment options
- **Provide education** about addiction, recovery, and treatment resources
- **Coordinate logistics** for assessment, admission, and transportation
- **Offer support** to family members before, during, and after intervention
- **Connect families** to appropriate resources and professional services
- **Prepare participants** through pre-intervention meetings and coaching
- **Follow up** to ensure continuity of care and family wellness

**What Interventionists DO NOT DO:**

- **Provide therapy or clinical treatment** (that's for licensed clinicians)
- **Make medical or psychiatric diagnoses** (that's for healthcare providers)
- **Prescribe medications or medical protocols** (that's for physicians)
- **Serve as a sponsor or recovery coach** (different role, different relationship)
- **Take custody or legal guardianship** (that's for family and legal authorities)
- **Guarantee outcomes or recovery** (no one can promise this)
- **Enable or collude** with continued substance use

### Understanding the Gray Areas

Real-world situations are rarely black and white. Consider these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: The Desperate Parent**

A mother calls you at 11 PM saying her son is suicidal and asking what medication he should take.

**Appropriate Response:**
- "I hear how scared you are. This is a medical emergency. Call 988 (Suicide Crisis Lifeline) or 911 immediately."
- "I'm not qualified to give medical advice, but I can help you access the right resources right now."
- Follow up the next day to offer support and intervention planning

**Inappropriate Response:**
- Attempting to diagnose or recommend medication
- Telling her to "wait and see if he calms down"
- Taking on the role of crisis counselor without proper training

**Scenario 2: The Treatment Center Referral**

You have relationships with several treatment centers. A family asks which one their loved one should attend.

**Appropriate Response:**
- "Based on your loved one's needs, I can present 3-4 options that match their clinical requirements, insurance, and preferences."
- Provide objective information about each program
- "The final choice is yours as a family, and I'll support whatever decision you make."
- Disclose any financial relationships you have with facilities

**Inappropriate Response:**
- Steering them to the facility that pays you the highest commission
- Claiming one facility is "the best" without clinical justification
- Making promises about outcomes at specific facilities

**Scenario 3: The Follow-Up Call**

Three months post-intervention, the individual calls you from treatment asking for advice about their romantic relationship.

**Appropriate Response:**
- "I'm so glad you're doing well in treatment! Relationship questions are something your therapist can help you process more deeply."
- "My role was to help facilitate your entry into care. Now your clinical team is the right resource for these personal decisions."
- Redirect them to appropriate therapeutic support

**Inappropriate Response:**
- Providing personal advice about their relationship
- Taking on an ongoing counseling role
- Overstepping the boundary of your initial professional relationship

### Reflection Exercise: Your Boundary Map

Take a few minutes to reflect on these questions:

**1. What draws you to intervention work?**
(Understanding your motivations helps you recognize when personal needs might blur professional boundaries)

**2. What situations might trigger you to overextend?**
(We all have vulnerability points—knowing yours helps you prepare)

**3. Who can you consult when facing a gray-area decision?**
(Build your professional support network now)

**4. What's your plan for self-care when carrying heavy stories?**
(Boundaries include protecting your own wellbeing)
