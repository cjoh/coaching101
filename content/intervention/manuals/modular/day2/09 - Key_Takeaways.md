## Key Takeaways: Day 2

1. **Boundaries are protective, not restrictive.** Clear scope of practice allows you to serve powerfully without overextending.

2. **Intervention is a continuum, not a single approach.** Match your mode to the situation—collaborative when possible, structured when needed, formal when resistance is high.

3. **Coordination is key to success.** The most effective interventions involve careful team-building, treatment planning, and follow-through.

4. **Crisis creates opportunity.** When someone is in crisis, act quickly and leverage the urgency for immediate treatment placement.

5. **Family isn't always the answer.** Sometimes one influential person has more impact than a room full of family members.

6. **Assessment drives strategy.** The first call assessment is your foundation—gather comprehensive information before recommending an approach.

7. **Preparation prevents problems.** Rehearse, role-play, and plan for every contingency. Winging it rarely works.

8. **Compassion and firmness coexist.** You can be loving AND hold clear boundaries. They're not opposites.
