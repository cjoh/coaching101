## Homework: Preparing for Day 3

**Before tomorrow's session:**

1. **Review your boundary map** from today's reflection exercise. Identify one area where you need to strengthen your boundaries.

2. **Practice writing an intervention statement** for someone you care about (even hypothetically). Use the structure learned today.

3. **Think of someone in your life who has been influential to you.** What made them effective? How can you embody those qualities as an interventionist?

4. **Read**: Review the 5-Mode Intervention Continuum. Come prepared with questions.
