## Section 2.3: First-Call Assessment

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Core Value:** Thorough understanding guides effective action

### The Critical First Conversation

The first call with a family sets the foundation for everything that follows. This is your opportunity to:
- Assess the urgency and severity of the situation
- Build trust and establish your role
- Gather comprehensive information
- Determine the appropriate intervention approach
- Set realistic expectations

### 2.3A: First-Call Structure

**Phase 1: Opening & Rapport (5 minutes)**

**Your Opening:**
"Thank you for reaching out. I know making this call takes courage. I'm here to listen, understand what's happening, and explore how I might be able to help."

**Immediate Questions:**
- "Is anyone in immediate danger right now?" (safety first)
- "Tell me what prompted you to call today."
- "How did you hear about intervention services?"

**Phase 2: Situation Assessment (15-20 minutes)**

**About the Individual:**

**Basic Information:**
- Name, age, living situation
- Substances used (primary and secondary)
- Duration and progression of use
- Current physical and mental health status
- Prior treatment or recovery attempts
- Legal issues or pending consequences
- Employment/school status

**Current Crisis Points:**
- "What happened recently that made you decide to call now?"
- "What are you most worried about?"
- "What's different about this time compared to previous concerns?"

**About the Family System:**

**Key Relationships:**
- Who is most affected by the substance use?
- Who has tried to help in the past?
- What's the family's relationship quality with the individual?
- Are there any family members who might resist the intervention?

**Previous Attempts:**
- "What have you already tried?"
- "How did the person respond to those attempts?"
- "What worked, even a little bit?"
- "What made things worse?"

**Resources & Constraints:**

**Practical Factors:**
- Insurance coverage or ability to pay for treatment
- Geographic preferences or limitations
- Timeline constraints or urgent deadlines
- Cultural or religious considerations
- Childcare, work, or other responsibilities

**Phase 3: Readiness Assessment (10 minutes)**

**Family Readiness:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how ready is the family to move forward with an intervention?"
- "What concerns or hesitations do you have?"
- "What would need to happen for you to feel fully ready?"

**Individual's Awareness:**
- "Does [name] know that the family is concerned?"
- "How do they typically respond when you bring up concerns about their substance use?"
- "Is there anyone they trust or listen to more than others?"

**Phase 4: Education & Next Steps (10 minutes)**

**Explain Your Process:**
- "Here's how intervention works in my practice..."
- "The goal isn't to shame or surprise anyoneâ€”it's to create a moment of clarity where change becomes possible."
- "We'll prepare carefully, involve the right people, and approach with compassion."

**Set Realistic Expectations:**
- "Intervention creates an opportunity for treatment. It doesn't guarantee acceptance."
- "About 80-90% of people agree to treatment when approached with preparation and compassion."
- "If they decline, we have a plan for that too."

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- Schedule follow-up consultation (usually in person)
- Request any relevant documentation (prior treatment records, legal documents)
- Begin identifying intervention team members
- Discuss timeline and urgency factors

**Phase 5: Closing (5 minutes)**

**Reassurance:**
- "You're doing the right thing by seeking help."
- "You don't have to figure this out alone."

**Logistics:**
- Confirm next appointment
- Share contact information for questions
- Provide crisis resources if needed

- [ ] Planned Formal Intervention (high resistance, low insight)
- [ ] Crisis Intervention (immediate danger, unstable situation)
- [ ] Individual Strategic Approach (family unavailable or unsafe to involve)
