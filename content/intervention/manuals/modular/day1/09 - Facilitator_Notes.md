# Facilitator Notes

**Pacing Considerations:**
- Day 1 is emotionally heavy—build in adequate break time
- Watch for participants who seem triggered or overwhelmed
- Have resources available for anyone who needs additional support
- Consider offering optional debrief time after the official day ends

**Common Challenges:**
- Participants may resist the gentler ARISE approach if they're expecting traditional intervention training
- Personal stories can take over if not gently redirected
- Some participants may not be ready for this level of self-examination
- Boundary confusion is common—return to clear distinctions repeatedly

**Success Indicators:**
- Participants can articulate the four core values
- Participants can distinguish intervention from other helping roles
- Participants show awareness of their own triggers and motivations
- The group has developed psychological safety and trust

**Adaptations:**
- If the group is small (<8), you can do more large group processing and less small group work
- If the group is large (>20), add more small group time and structure sharing carefully
- For groups with varied experience levels, pair experienced and new people strategically
- For groups with significant trauma histories, move more slowly through personal story work
