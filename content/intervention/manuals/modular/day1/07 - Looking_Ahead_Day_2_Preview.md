# Looking Ahead: Day 2 Preview

**What's Coming:**

Day 2 takes the foundation you built today and gives you concrete tools and structures:

**Morning:** The ARISE method in detail—how to conduct first calls, assess family systems, and facilitate Level 1 meetings

**Mid-morning:** Impact letters—the heart of Level 2 interventions

**Afternoon:** Treatment planning, placement, and logistics

**Late afternoon:** Family meeting facilitation and managing different outcomes

**The Shift:**

Day 1 was about awareness and self-knowledge. Day 2 is about structure and skill-building. Day 3 will bring it all together through practice.

**What to Remember:**

No matter how many techniques you learn tomorrow, they only work if they rest on the foundation of values and self-awareness you built today. Keep returning to that foundation.
