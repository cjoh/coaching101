# Session 3.3B: Role-Play Round 2 (11:45 AM–12:45 PM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

The second round of roleplays continues the practice and feedback cycle. Depending on group size, this session may include 1–2 additional scenarios. The focus shifts slightly from individual performance to **pattern recognition**—noticing what strategies work across multiple scenarios and what common challenges emerge.

---

## Facilitation Guide

**Opening (3 minutes)**

> "We've seen two powerful roleplays this morning. Now we're going to continue with additional scenarios. As you observe this round, I want you to start noticing patterns: What strategies seem to work across different scenarios? What challenges keep coming up?"

---

**Roleplay Structure (Same as Round 1)**

Follow the same structure as Session 3.3A:

- Setup (2 minutes)
- Roleplay (20 minutes)
- Pause for reflection (3 minutes)
- Structured feedback (15 minutes)

If time allows, facilitate a second roleplay using the same structure.

---

**Integration Discussion (15 minutes)**

After the final roleplay, facilitate a brief integration discussion:

**Prompt 1: Patterns Across Scenarios**

> "What patterns are you noticing across all the roleplays? What strategies seem to work consistently?"

Examples participants might name:

- Slowing down the opening creates safety
- Reflecting emotions back to speakers helps them feel heard
- Staying calm when the Pivot Person gets defensive prevents escalation
- Using values-based language (connection, care, hope) is more effective than clinical language

---

**Prompt 2: Common Challenges**

> "What challenges keep coming up? What seems hardest for interventionists to navigate?"

Examples participants might name:

- Managing time—knowing when to let someone speak longer and when to move on
- Handling resistance without becoming defensive
- Staying present when emotions run high
- Balancing compassion with structure

---

**Prompt 3: Personal Insights**

> "What's something you learned about yourself by observing or participating in these roleplays?"

Allow a few participants to share. Close with:

> "You've done incredible work this morning. Let's take a lunch break, and we'll come back this afternoon to process what came up."

---

**Personal Roleplay Reflection (In Workbook)**

Participants who facilitated or played roles during the session should complete the following reflection prompts during lunch or later in the afternoon:

- **My role in the simulation:** (e.g., Interventionist, Pivot Person, family member)
- **What felt most challenging:** (Difficult moments, uncertainties)
- **What surprised me:** (Insights or breakthroughs)
- **Feedback I received from observers:** (Constructive feedback from the group)
- **Key takeaway from all simulations:** (What I'm taking forward from this practice)

---

**LUNCH BREAK (12:45–1:45 PM — 60 minutes)**

Participants need extended time to eat, decompress, and process the emotional intensity of the morning. Encourage self-care during lunch—people should not feel obligated to debrief or discuss the roleplays unless they want to.
