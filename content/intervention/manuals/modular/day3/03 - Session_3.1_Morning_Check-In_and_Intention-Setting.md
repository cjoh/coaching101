# Session 3.1: Morning Check-In & Intention-Setting (9:00–9:30 AM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

Day 3 begins with grounding. Before stepping into the intensity of roleplay practice, we create space for participants to arrive fully—body, mind, and heart. This session is about **readiness assessment**, intention-setting, and building group safety for the vulnerable work ahead.

## Why This Matters

Intervention practice is emotionally demanding. Participants may feel nervous, excited, uncertain, or vulnerable. Creating space to name these feelings—and to articulate what support is needed—builds psychological safety and sets the tone for a day of courageous practice.

The morning check-in also serves as a **baseline assessment**. By asking participants to reflect on their physical, mental, and emotional state, facilitators can identify anyone who may need additional support or modified participation during the day.

## Facilitation Guide

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin the day with a brief grounding exercise:

> "Good morning. We've spent two days building awareness and learning coordination skills. Today is about practice—stepping into the role of interventionist and discovering what you are capable of. Before we begin, let's take a moment to ground ourselves in this space."

**Lead a 2-minute grounding practice:**

- "Close your eyes if that feels comfortable. Take three deep breaths."
- "Notice where you are—the sounds, the temperature, the feeling of your feet on the floor."
- "Notice what you're bringing into this room today—energy, nervousness, excitement, fatigue. Whatever it is, it's welcome here."
- "Set an intention for yourself: What do you want to learn or practice today?"

After the grounding, transition to the reflection prompts:

> "We're going to start with a few reflection questions. Please take your time with these—they're just for you, though you'll have the option to share with the group if you'd like."

**Reflection Prompts (20 minutes)**

Guide participants through the following prompts, allowing time for individual reflection before inviting group sharing:

1. **How I'm feeling this morning (body, mind, heart):**
   - *"Check in with yourself. What's your energy level? How's your mental clarity? What emotions are present?"*
   - Facilitator note: Watch for signs of fatigue, anxiety, or overwhelm. If someone shares significant distress, check in with them privately during the break.

2. **My intention for today's role-plays:**
   - *"What do you want to practice or learn today? This isn't about performing perfectly—it's about growth."*
   - Examples participants might name: staying present under pressure, managing my own emotions, practicing the opening script, handling resistance with grace.

3. **One thing I'm nervous about:**
   - *"It's normal to feel nervous. What feels challenging or uncertain for you today?"*
   - Normalize nervousness: "If you're not at least a little nervous, you're probably not taking this seriously enough. This work matters, and it's okay to feel the weight of it."

4. **One strength I bring to today:**
   - *"What are you confident in? What skills, experiences, or qualities do you already have that will serve you well?"*
   - Encourage participants to name specific strengths: listening skills, lived experience, calm presence, ability to hold space for emotions.

5. **Support I need from the group today:**
   - *"What would help you learn and practice today? What do you need from your peers and facilitators?"*
   - Examples: honest feedback, patience, encouragement, reminders to breathe.

**Group Sharing (Optional — 5 minutes)**

Invite a few volunteers to share one of their reflections with the group. Do not require everyone to share—this is about creating space for connection, not performance.

After sharing, close the session:

> "Thank you for your honesty and your presence. Today is going to be challenging, and it's also going to be transformative. We're in this together. Let's move into the day with courage and care."

## Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Choice**: Participants are not required to share aloud. Written reflection is sufficient.
- **Pacing**: Do not rush. Allow silence and processing time.
- **Safety**: If someone shares significant distress (e.g., "I didn't sleep last night because I'm terrified"), check in privately and offer options for modified participation.
- **Empowerment**: Frame nervousness as appropriate, not as a deficit. Normalize the emotional weight of this work.
