# Facilitator Self-Care After Day 3

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

## Facilitator Debrief

After participants leave, facilitators should take time to debrief together. Day 3 is emotionally demanding for facilitators as wellâ€”holding space for vulnerable practice, managing group dynamics, and providing feedback requires significant energy.

**Debrief Prompts:**

- What went well today?
- What was challenging?
- Were there any participants we need to follow up with?
- What would we do differently next time?
- How are we feeling?

**Facilitator Self-Care:**

- Take time to rest and recover before the next training
- Seek peer consultation if anything felt ethically complex
- Celebrate the workâ€”facilitating intervention training is sacred work

## Trauma-Informed Training: A Meta-Reflection

This training is designed to **model** trauma-informed care at every level. Facilitators are not just teaching trauma-informed principlesâ€”they are embodying them. This means:

- **Safety**: Creating a container where participants can be vulnerable without fear of judgment
- **Trustworthiness**: Following through on commitments, honoring boundaries, maintaining confidentiality
- **Choice**: Offering options, never forcing participation, respecting autonomy
- **Collaboration**: Learning together, not hierarchicallyâ€”facilitators are guides, not gurus
- **Empowerment**: Naming strengths, building confidence, affirming courage

If participants leave Day 3 feeling seen, supported, and capableâ€”even if they also feel challenged and uncertainâ€”you have succeeded.
