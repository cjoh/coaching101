# Introduction 

## Welcome to Core Values family recovery coaching 

Family recovery is not about fixing the addicted person—it's about healing the entire family system. As a Core Values family recovery coach, you will guide families through a transformative 52-week journey that shifts focus from crisis management to values-based living, from codependency to healthy interdependence, and from chaos to emotional sobriety. 

### What is a CORE VALUES family recovery coach

A family recovery coach is a professional who helps families navigate the challenges of having a family with any type of addiction. 

### What they do

* Educate families about addiction and recovery   
* Help families make healthy choices and communication patterns   
* Helps connect those seeking recovery to the appropriate resources  
* Support family members dealing with trauma and codependency   
* Prevent enabling behaviors while promoting healing 

Most have training in recovery coaching, intervention, addiction counseling, social work, or psychology with specialized certification in family dynamics and addiction. 

**When to seek help:** Families typically work with coaches when they feel overwhelmed – when they’re unsure how to help without enabling, dealing with repeated relapses, or wanting to repair damaged relationships. The coach helps the entire family system heal and develop effective strategies to support recovery while protecting their own well-being. 

### What family recovery coaching is “Not” 

* Clinical therapy or medical treatment   
* A cure or guarantee of sobriety   
* Crisis intervention or emergency services   
* Decision-making for families   
* Treatment for the addicted person  
* A replacement for professional addiction treatment   
* A quick fix or miracle solution 

### HOW ARE CORE VALUES FAMILY RECOVERY COACHES  different FROM OTHER COACHES

* We are trained to work with other professionals in a collaborative environment where we all understand each others roles  
* We are technically informed  
* We have curriculum that is shared  
* We share a common language  
* We share common ethics  
* We share a common mentorship community

### Who Can Be a Core Values Family RECOVERY Coach

1. **Personal Experience:** Either lived experience with addiction in families or professional experience working with family systems affected by addiction   
2. **Recovery Foundation:** Understanding of recovery principles, 12-step programs, and family dynamics in addiction   
3. **Coaching Training:** Background in coaching (family recovery coaching, life coaching, or recovery coaching preferred)

### WHAT IS CORE VALUES FAMILY RECOVERY COACHING

Core values family recovery coaching is a XX week coaching program led by a core values family recovery coach

### The Core Values family recovery coaching Difference 

Unlike traditional family therapy or Al-Anon groups, Core Values family recovery coaching:

* Operates from a coaching model focused on forward movement and goals   
* Uses the 52-week structured curriculum as a roadmap   
* Integrates seamlessly with individual coaching and intervention services   
* Emphasizes values-based decision making over problem-focused discussions  
* Delivers services remotely for accessibility and consistency   
* Focuses on creating a "new normal" rather than returning to pre-addiction dynamics 

## Core Values Roles and Boundaries

![][image1]

Core Values Certified Coaches believe that recovery is a team sport. What makes our program different from other programs in the field is our **capacity to work together.** We know where our work begins and another’s begins. We collaborate seamlessly in service to our clients, and to each other. 

1. ### Peer support

**Primary Focus:** Connection, accountability, and modeling recovery   
**Serves:** The **pivot person** in early or ongoing recovery

**Definition**: A Peer Support is someone with lived experience in recovery who walks alongside others beginning or deepening their own recovery journey. Their power comes from identification, not instruction. They model hope, consistency, and honesty—helping clients stay connected to community, values, and daily recovery actions.

**Boundaries:** 

* Does not provide therapy, diagnose, or prescribe  
* Does not provide structured coaching  
* Does not take clients through the 12 steps (but may take them to meetings)  
* Does not design treatment plans or direct interventions   
* Does share personal experience appropriately and use it to build trust  
* Does help the client experience life in sobriety

**Focus:** Support, connection

2. ### Executive Recovery Coach

**Primary Focus:** Long-term growth, integration, and optimization, typically collaborates with a family coach   
**Serves:** **The pivot person** ready for structured growth

**Definition:** An Executive Recovery Coach is a trained professional coach who helps clients translate recovery principles into sustainable life practices such as putting plans and actions into effect. They bridge the gap between recovery and leadership—helping clients with executive function skills including planning and organization, time management, emotional regulation and task initiation.  This leads to helping the client clarify values, set goals, develop habits, and embody integrity in every domain of life.

**Boundaries:** 

* Does not provide clinical or diagnostic treatment   
* Does not replace sponsorship or therapy   
* Does not act as an interventionist if the pivot person relapses  
* Does collaborate with a family coach  
* Does hold clients accountable to their own goals, values, and commitments  
* Does not advocate for the family, but helps the client advocate for themselves

**Focus:** Growth, structure, performance, and alignment with core values

3. ### Interventionist

**Primary Focus:** Connection, stabilization, and coordination of care 

**Serves:** The **family system** seeking to help a loved one enter recovery

**Definition:** An Interventionist guides families through the process of helping a loved one move from crisis to connection. They translate fear, chaos, and emotion into coordinated action. Their role blends assessment, planning, and compassionate confrontation — helping families make decisions, access resources, and begin the recovery journey together.

**Boundaries:** 

* Does not provide long-term coaching or therapy   
* Does not force outcomes through coercion or control   
* Does advocates for the individual and the family system 

**Focus:** Stabilization, coordination, advocacy, and transition into recovery

4. ### Family Coach

**Primary Focus:** Healing, boundaries, and relational recovery   
**Serves**: **The family** members and loved ones of someone in recovery

**Definition:** A Family Coach supports family members as they heal from the impact of addiction and learn to live their own recovery. They help loved ones understand codependency, set boundaries, and reconnect with their own values and well-being. The work often parallels the individual’s recovery but focuses on the family’s side of the street.

**Boundaries:** 

* Does not manage the addicted person’s treatment or recovery plan   
* Does not act as the loved one’s therapist or case manager   
* Does collaborate with the Executive Coach  
* Does help family members practice detachment, communication, and self-care   
* Focus: Family growth, boundaries, recovery education, and emotional resilience

## Ethics and Professional Standards

### Why We Lead with Ethics

Ethics are the foundation of Core Values Coaching. You can’t have values without ethics. If we want to help our clients connect with their values, we must lay a solid foundation upon which that connection can rest, and that foundation must be built with ethics. Focusing on ethics from the start shows that we don't just talk about values but live by them. It ensures that how we act as coaches matches the honesty and realness we want to teach our clients. Being ethical in coaching is more than just following rules; it's about living the values we believe in.

Admitting that we can hurt others is a severe but necessary part of ethical coaching. The relationship between a coach and client is naturally unbalanced regarding power and influence, especially in the early phases of recovery, where this program is mainly applied. Ethical coaching protects against this imbalance causing harm, whether through misusing power, crossing boundaries, or misunderstanding roles. It's a promise not to hurt anyone, putting the client's well-being, independence, and growth first.

### Our Code of Ethics:

**As a Core Values Coach, I Will:**

1. Accurately identify my qualifications, expertise, and certifications to all I serve and the public.  
   2. Conduct myself by this Code of Ethics.  
   3. Remain free from any substances that affect my ability to perform my duties as a Core Values Coach.  
   4. Honor my client’s time by making my work with them about them, not about me.  
   5. Recognize personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that may impact my performance as a Core Values Coach.  
   6. Maintain connections with other coaches so that I can address personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that negatively affect my recovery.  
   7. Respect and acknowledge the professional efforts and contributions of others.  
   8. Maintain documentation for all client records.  
   9. Protect the privacy and confidentiality of all clients.  
   10. I will immediately disclose any perceived conflict of interest to my client and to another coach and make an outbound referral if necessary.  
   11. Disclose any pre-existing professional, social, or business relationships that may affect my client.   
   12. Terminate the relationship when it ceases to be helpful to the client.  
   13. Refer the client out to a relevant therapist and cease coaching when necessary.  
   14. Keep and maintain appropriate, culturally sensitive boundaries with everyone I serve.  
   15. Not engage in sexual or personal relationships with any client or client family members.

### ETHICS AND FAMILY COACHING

Ethics are the invisible architecture that holds family coaching together. In a setting where emotions run high and vulnerability is at its peak, clear ethical grounding ensures that compassion never drifts into confusion, and care never crosses into control. Family coaching is about trust. When families allow a coach into their private world, they are extending deep permission to see and influence sensitive dynamics. Ethics safeguard that trust by defining how power, empathy, and professionalism must coexist. They remind us that good intentions aren’t enough; integrity must shape every choice we make.

Unlike individual coaching, **family coaching involves** a network of relationships where influence flows in multiple directions. The coach is often seen as a stabilizing force during turbulent times, and with that perception comes tremendous responsibility. Ethical standards protect everyone in that space: the Pivot Person, the family, and the coach. They keep the focus on the client’s autonomy and the family’s growth, not the coach’s opinions, needs, or sense of importance. By leading with ethics, we ensure that every action aligns with our values of honesty, respect, and shared responsibility.

Ethics also teach coaches to lead by example. When we demonstrate transparency, accountability, and self-awareness, we model the very qualities we hope to awaken in the families we serve. In this way, ethics are a **practice of alignment**, a daily commitment to walk the talk of recovery and values-based living. Ethical integrity doesn’t just make coaching safer; it makes it transformative.

###  WORKING WITH THE OUTSIDE: Coaches, Therapists, and Sponsors

![][image2]

**Therapists** bring a clinical view to healing, dealing with trauma and mental illness with professional knowledge. They often focus on healing past hurts and looking at the client's history to find and fix the causes of current problems. This relationship has professional boundaries, with therapists staying distant to give objective, therapeutic support. Therapy is a space for exploring and healing, where clients are encouraged to lead their recovery journey.

**Sponsors** guide their sponsees through the 12 steps with care and understanding. They act as mentors, sharing their recovery journeys to light the way for others. Their role is hands-on, giving real-time support and being someone to talk to about day-to-day challenges. The sponsor-client relationship is marked by being available and sharing experiences, creating a special bond based on everyday struggles and successes.

**Core Values Coaches** support the client's future self, encouraging them to imagine and work towards their best version. This role looks to the future, focusing on creating a vision and setting goals to reach it. Coaches challenge clients to step out of their comfort zones, recognizing and dealing with the voice of addiction that may hold them back. By sharing personal stories when appropriate, coaches give practical insights and accountability, helping clients find and use the support and resources they need to succeed.

We Core Values Coaches must adhere to strict boundaries and “know our lane” when working with clients. We should work to support and encourage our family clients to have good relationships with their loved one, both their sponsors if applicable and therapists if applicable  and we should usually help our clients follow their guidance. Coaches will want to create positive relationships with any other professionals their therapists and work as a team to support their clients' recovery. But before doing so, we must seek permission from our clients to disclose our relationships with their therapist. We do so by getting a formal Release of Information (ROI) signed by our client and their therapist so that everyone knows the disclosure and the confidentiality. The same goes for collaborating with an Executive Coach, we must have the clients permission prior to sharing any information.

**The boundary between a coach and a sponsor** is essential to keep the coaching relationship strong. While a Core Values Coach may personally take part in 12-step programs, their professional role is separate. Direct involvement in the client's 12-step journey, like going to 12-step meetings together, is kept to a minimum to ensure the coach stays an objective, supportive figure focused on the client's overall recovery journey and to create space for the client to establish connections in the 12-step rooms. Often, when a coach is present, a client may have difficulty finding a sponsor, as it’s assumed that the coach is the sponsor. The coach should always follow the sponsor's lead regarding the client's 12-step work. This separation ensures that the unique benefits of both sponsorship and coaching are kept, giving full support for the person's recovery.

It’s also worth noting that the coach may not disclose their relationship to anyone, even in a 12-step room. While the client may disclose that their coach is their coach, it is inappropriate for the coach to disclose that relationship as it is a breach of confidentiality. It is best to bring clients into meetings to help them walk through the door and then get out of the way so you are not mistaken for a sponsor. 

**The boundary between a coach and a therapist** is also vital. A therapist generally works from the present and into the past. They help heal past trauma, process emotional reactions, and help pull apart and understand conflict. A core values coach works from the present and into the future. We set goals and create visions for the future. We help challenge assumptions and interpretations of events, but we don’t spend much time trying to fix or heal our clients — we aren't usually the ones who handle that. If we do, we must encourage our client to work with their therapist or make a therapeutic referral. 

Therapists also diagnose people with words like “depression,” “PTSD,” “codependency,” and even “addiction.” Core values coaches tend to shy away from these words, other than helping clients put a name to feelings and encouraging them to seek therapeutic resources to investigate further. Coaches focus on helping clients build a positive future rather than diagnosing issues from the past. We empower clients to create their own solutions, offering guidance and support without trying to "fix" them. If deeper emotional work is needed, we refer to therapists who are trained to handle those situations.

By staying in our lane and respecting professional boundaries, Core Values Coaches create a safe space for growth and self-discovery, complementing the important work of therapists and sponsors.

***As Core Values Coaches, we expect the sponsors and therapists working with our clients to be ethical.*** If we spot unethical behavior, we guide our clients to the appropriate resources to handle the situation. We can often use the moment to teach our clients about values while empowering them to make their own choices. We do not often rescue our clients but provide them with the resources to rescue themselves. When in doubt about what to do, we seek the guidance of other coaches.

# LANGUAGE CHOICES

**Healthy Choices vs Boundaries**

We use the term **“Healthy Choices”** rather than “boundaries” because it places ownership and empowerment squarely where it belongs—with the individual making the choice. The language of “boundaries” can subtly reinforce the idea that our actions are reactions to someone else’s behavior, especially the Pivot Person’s. “Healthy Choices” reframes that dynamic. It reminds each family member that they are responsible for their own emotional safety, energy, and engagement, regardless of what others do. This shift moves the focus from *controlling or protecting against another person* to *honoring one’s own values and limits*. It’s about choosing what aligns with well-being, rather than policing what others can or can’t do. In this way, “Healthy Choices” becomes a language of agency, self-respect, and calm strength—an empowering practice that models the same self-leadership we hope the Pivot Person will develop in their own recovery.

**Pivot Person vs. Person of Concern**

We intentionally use the term **“Pivot Person”** instead of “Person of Concern” because language shapes relationship—and relationship shapes recovery. “Person of Concern” subtly reinforces a one-directional focus: concern *about* someone, often placing them at the center of the problem. That framing can unintentionally isolate or objectify the individual, suggesting that the family’s work revolves around them.

**“Pivot Person,”** by contrast, invites shared responsibility and movement. It acknowledges that this person’s struggle has created a natural *pivot point* for the whole family system to turn toward growth and recovery. The word “pivot” implies action, agency, and interconnection—something *we do together*, not something *we fix in someone else.*

In this framing, the Pivot Person becomes a *peer* in the family’s recovery process, not a patient or project. Their willingness to change is deeply valuable, but it’s matched by the family’s willingness to look at their own adaptations, coping styles, and opportunities for healing. The family pivots *with* them. This shift transforms blame into collaboration and concern into collective transformation—because sustainable recovery happens when everyone learns to move together.

# Essential Skills for family recovery coaching 

## The 80% Rule: Core Coaching Competencies 

The following skills represent 80% of effective family recovery coaching. Master these fundamentals before advancing to specialized techniques. 

### 1\. Acknowledging and Validating 

Acknowledging and validating is the foundational practice of recognizing and affirming a client's experiences, emotions, and perspectives without judgment or the need to fix or change them. This competency involves actively listening to what the client shares and reflecting back that their feelings, thoughts, and experiences are real, understandable, and worthy of attention. When a coach acknowledges and validates effectively, they create a safe container for honest exploration and growth. 

This doesn't mean agreeing with every choice or perspective a client presents; rather, it means honoring their internal experience as legitimate and meaningful. Validation helps clients feel seen and heard, which reduces defensiveness and opens pathways for deeper self-reflection. In family systems affected by addiction or crisis, this competency is particularly crucial, as individuals often feel dismissed, blamed, or invisible within their family dynamics. By providing authentic acknowledgment, coaches help clients reconnect with their own wisdom and inner resources.

#### In Practice: 

* "I can see how exhausting it's been to live with this uncertainty"   
* "Your anger makes complete sense given what you've been through"   
* "It takes courage to admit that the old ways aren't working" 

#### Key Points: 

* Validation doesn't mean agreement with behavior   
* Acknowledge effort and progress, not just outcomes   
* Mirror emotional tone to show attunement   
* Avoid rushing to solutions before feelings are heard 

### 2\. Asking Empowering Open-Ended Questions 

The art of asking empowering, open-ended questions is one of the most powerful tools in a coach's repertoire. Unlike closed questions that elicit simple yes or no answers, open-ended questions invite exploration, reflection, and discovery. Empowering questions are specifically crafted to shift clients from problem-focused thinking to possibility-focused thinking, from external blame to internal agency, and from confusion to clarity. 

These questions typically begin with **"what," "how," or "who" *rather than "why,"*** which can trigger defensiveness or intellectualization. The most effective empowering questions challenge assumptions, expand perspectives, and invite clients to access their own wisdom rather than looking to the coach for answers. Questions like "What would be possible if you believed you deserved support?" or "How might you respond differently if you trusted your own judgment?" move clients toward self-authorship of their lives. This competency requires coaches to remain genuinely curious, to trust the client's capacity for insight, and to resist the temptation to ask leading questions that reflect the coach's agenda rather than the client's discovery process.

#### In Practice: 

* "What would detachment with love look like for you?"   
* "How do you know when you're operating from values versus fear?"   
* "What boundaries would need to be in place to healthy choices would help you feel safer feel safer in this relationship?"   
* "Where do you notice yourself trying to control outcomes?" 

#### Avoid: 

* Leading questions ("Don't you think you should set a health choice?")   
* Yes/no questions ("Are you ready to let go?")   
* Multiple questions stacked together  
* Questions that contain hidden advice 

### 

### 3\. Obtaining Buy-In 

Obtaining buy-in is the collaborative process of ensuring that clients are genuinely invested in and committed to the coaching relationship, the goals they set, and the actions they choose to take. This competency goes far beyond simple agreement; it involves creating authentic alignment between what the client says they want and what they're truly willing to do. Effective coaches recognize that lasting change cannot be imposed or persuaded into being—it must emerge from the client's own motivation and readiness.

Obtaining buy-in requires coaches to slow down, check assumptions, and explicitly invite clients to assess their own commitment levels. This might sound like, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how committed do you feel to this action step?" or "What would make this goal feel truly meaningful to you?" When clients haven't genuinely bought in, they may sabotage their own progress, disappear from coaching, or go through the motions without real engagement. By prioritizing authentic buy-in over surface-level compliance, coaches honor client autonomy and create the conditions for sustainable transformation. This is especially important when working with family systems, where individuals may feel pressure to change to please others rather than from their own internal conviction.

#### In Practice: 

* "What resonates with you about this approach?"   
* "How does this week's focus align with what you're experiencing?"   
* "Would it be helpful to explore this further?"   
* "What feels most important to work on right now?" 

#### Signs of Strong Buy-In: 

* Family members actively participate in homework   
* They bring up concepts from previous sessions   
* They ask questions and seek clarification   
* They express ownership of their recovery process 

### 

### 4\. Strategic Self-Disclosure

Strategic self-disclosure is the intentional and boundaried sharing of the coach's own experiences, feelings, or observations in service of the client's growth and learning. Unlike casual conversation or friendship, where self-disclosure may be mutual and unfiltered, coaching self-disclosure is always purposeful, brief, and client-centered. When used skillfully, strategic self-disclosure can normalize difficult experiences, model vulnerability, challenge isolation, or provide a relational mirror that helps clients see themselves more clearly. A coach might share a brief personal example to illustrate that they understand a particular struggle, or might disclose an observation about how they're feeling in the moment with the client to provide valuable feedback about interpersonal dynamics. 

This competency requires significant discernment and restraint. The coach must always ask: "Is this disclosure in service of my client's needs, or my own?" Effective self-disclosure is brief, relevant, and followed by redirecting attention back to the client. It should never burden the client with the coach's unresolved issues, create role confusion, or shift the focus of the coaching relationship. When used strategically, self-disclosure deepens trust, strengthens the coaching alliance, and demonstrates the kind of authentic, boundaried relating that clients can model in their own lives.

#### When to Share Personal Experience: 

* To normalize difficult emotions or experiences   
* To model vulnerability and growth   
* To provide hope during discouraging moments   
* To illustrate a concept or principle 

#### How to Share Effectively: 

1. Ask permission first: "Would a brief example from my experience be helpful?" 2\. Keep it concise: Under 90 seconds   
2. Make it relevant: Directly connected to their current situation   
3. Return focus to them: "What resonates with you about that?" 

#### Risks to Avoid: 

* Making sessions about your story   
* Blurring professional boundaries  
* Competing with their experience   
* Providing unsolicited advice through stories

# The Three STAGES OF FAMILY RECOVERY

## Understanding the Journey: A Three-Stage Framework for Family Recovery

Recovery unfolds in phases, each with its own signals of recovery and relapse, challenges, and breakthroughs. For families navigating the complex terrain of addiction recovery, one of the most disorienting aspects can be not knowing where they are in the process or what to expect next. The Three Stages of Family Recovery — Landing, Stabilization, and Optimization — provide a compassionate roadmap that helps families make sense of their experience. This framework isn't about imposing rigid timelines or measuring success; it's about creating a shared language that transforms confusion into a clear plan. When we can name what's happening, we reduce shame, normalize challenges, and illuminate the path forward. As coaches, our role is to gently reflect back what we see, helping families recognize where they are without judgment and offering hope for what's possible when they engage in the recovery process. This developmental lens allows us to meet families exactly where they are—honoring their unique pace while holding steady confidence in their capacity to heal and grow together.

Recovery is not a single event—it’s a progression of awareness, stabilization, and growth that unfolds over time. By breaking the process into three distinct phases—**Landing, Stabilization, and Optimization**—we give both the Pivot Person and their family a clear map of where they are and what comes next. This structure helps families move from confusion and crisis toward clarity and confidence, step by step.

Our coaching methodology is built around *awareness and reflection*. Families often enter the recovery process reacting to crises, not recognizing the patterns that have shaped their responses. By naming each phase and describing what’s happening within it, we create language that transforms chaos into understanding. When a coach can gently mirror back, “This is the phase your family is in,” it brings relief, validation, and a sense of direction.

The three-phase model isn’t meant to label or grade a family—it’s meant to *show them where they are at* so they can move forward with awareness. When we reference these stages in conversation, we’re not diagnosing; we’re simply holding up a mirror to the system so the family can see itself more clearly.

In practice, this might sound like:

“What you’re describing sounds a lot like the Landing phase—everything feels uncertain and urgent right now. That’s a normal beginning place.”

or

“It seems your family is entering Stabilization—you’re building consistency, and trust is starting to return.”

These reflections give families orientation. They transform shame into understanding and overwhelm into a sense of pathway.  Our role is to **shepherd**, not steer. We create a safe space where the family can recognize patterns, celebrate progress, and prepare for the next stage. We use gentle curiosity and language that centers partnership—reminding them that recovery is something they walk through *together*, not something they do *to* the Pivot Person.

## STAGE 1: Acceptance/Landing

In the Acceptance/Landing phase, the Pivot Person is coming to terms with the reality of their condition and beginning to accept help. It’s an emotionally charged period marked by denial, fear, and surrender. The family often experiences equal turbulence—relief that change is beginning mixed with anxiety about what it means. This is when emotional containment and clear boundaries are most needed from the family system.

#### What’s Happening: 

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Acceptance of disease Withdrawal White Knuckling Denial Intervention Residential Treatment Monitoring | Confrontation of disease Acceptance of responsibility Shock, anger, shame, denial Transition from enabling to establishing healthy choices Seeking of external help and professional guidance |

#### Relapse Signs:  (Probability: 75-85% \- High Risk)

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Lack of acceptance Leaving AMA Compartmentalizing family & external resources Not accepting intervention “I can do it on my own/I got this” | Doubting or undermining professional help Control of Pivot Person’s Recovery Reverting to denial Secret Enabling Power gatekeeping  |

#### What Transition to next phase looks like:

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Acceptance of disease Surrender (doing what is asked) Reduction in game-playing Home group & Sponsor Regular meeting attendance | Willingness to work with outside Willingness to work as a team Have independent resources Reduction in enablement Reduction in resentment  |

## STAGE 2: STABILIZATION

During Stabilization, the Pivot Person is developing consistency—attending meetings, engaging in step work, and building accountability structures. This is the phase of learning new rhythms and rebuilding trust. For the family, it’s about recalibrating roles and expectations, supporting autonomy, and letting the Pivot Person take responsibility for their own growth without micromanaging.

#### What’s Happening: 

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| I will not drink today Step Work/90 in 90 Sober lIving/PHP/IOP Peer Support Therapy/MAT Service Positions Monitoring/Accountability | Relax from crisis Adjustment to “new normal” Attendance of family programs Practicing detachment with love Consistency and Communication Accountability replaces emotional rescue |

#### Relapse Signs:  (Probability: 60-70% \- Elevated Risk)

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Lack of acceptance Leaving AMA Compartmentalizing family & external resources Not accepting intervention “I can do it on my own/I got this” | Things are fixed now \- disengage Minimizing ongoing risk of relapse Slipping back into comfortable roles \- caretaker, enforcer, or victim Return to enablement Avoiding uncomfortable conversations  |

#### What Transition to next phase looks like:

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Follow through on commitments Spiritual practice Shift from obligation to privilege Completion of 12 steps Improved emotional regulation | Consistent healthy choices Safe, calm, predictable household Shared growth and purpose  Pivot person is less of a focus Appreciation of new normal  |

---

## STAGE 3: Optimization

In Optimization, the Pivot Person is achieving emotional stability and reintegration—aligning recovery with career, purpose, and relationships. This is a phase of maintenance, leadership, and meaning. For the family, the work deepens: it’s about sustaining connection without dependence, fostering mutual growth, and continuing to model healthy individuality and unity.

#### What’s Happening: 

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Emotional sobriety Integration with career Sponsorship Service and leadership Privilege over obligation Maintenance | Healthy patterns of communication Protection moves to partnership Family works on their own growth Focus moves to shared values & contribution Thriving rather than surviving |

#### Relapse Signs:  (Probability: 20-40% and reducing over time \- Reduced Risk)

| The Pivot Person | The Family |
| :---- | :---- |
| Stagnation Lack of integration with career Secret-keeping Separation from recovery program Loss of routine Assuming recovery is permanent | Assuming recovery is permanent Neglecting family self care Failing to process lingering wounds Loss of shared routines Return to obligation based behavior Emotional distance  |

# How the program works

Our job as coaches is to shepherd and guide our families through the three stages of recovery alongside our collaborators. The Core Values Family coaching program is designed to last for one year, with most of the intensive work happening in the first ten [weeks.](http://weeks.As) The family begins to get answers to their concerns and behaviors begin to change. The family is able to find a safe place  to move forward. This is a parallel process .This means the  “pivot person” and family are working to better understand their recovery. Each module can be used independently , but the modules are designed to flow together.  Some families may need more time with an individual module . A coach may discover that an individual family member may need more support in understanding a module.  Supporting this family member may take some individual sessions. The coach continues to move forward while supporting the individual as well as the rest of the family. The coach will learn with each session the support needed to create a supportive forward moving plan.  The first session is to identify the needs and concerns of the family. Validate the family and begin to share how the process works.

The coach prioritizes each of the 10 modules ;

1.The First session.

2.Circle of Control

3\. Why addiction feels personal

4.Secrets in Addiction

5\. Expectations our Demise

6\. Blocks

7\. Core Values

8\. Power of the Pause

9.Responding vs Reacting

10\. Love vs Enabling

11\. Grief That Does Not Have a Funeral/ Detach with Love

12\.  Discussing what the family has learned about themselves. Discover and discuss applications that need  more support.

THe system is designed to take the family through a journey of learning new skills , introspection, and forward thinking . The curriculum is designed to create positive change in the family system. Some sessions may take longer for family members to grasp . Stay with them \!\!\!\! As the coach continues to support the family, they will be able to identify changes and thought patterns that will improve their recovery. The coach is able to allow the family to direct sessions and find their answers.

# Module Description

## Module: Circle of Control

### Description:

This module helps clients understand what they can and cannot control. By focusing on their own thoughts, actions, and choices, clients learn to let go of trying to control others — especially a loved one’s addiction. This shift brings more peace, acceptance, and emotional balance.

### Goals:

* Understand the difference between what’s **in your control** and what’s **not**  
* Learn to focus energy on your own actions and responses  
* Practice letting go of what you can’t control  
* Build healthier boundaries and self-care habits

### Coach’s Role:

The coach helps the client see where they have control, guides reflection, and supports practicing acceptance over control.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Circle of Control

### 1\. What’s in My Control

Draw two circles:

* **Inside:** What I *can* control (my actions, thoughts, choices).  
* **Outside:** What I *can’t* control (others, addiction, the past).  
  Write examples in each circle.

---

### 2\. Focus Shift

Think of one stressful situation.  
Ask yourself:

* What can I control here?  
* What can’t I control?  
* What healthy action can I take?

---

### 3\. Letting Go

Write one thing you need to release.  
Take a deep breath and say:

“I let go of what isn’t mine to control.”

## Session Rundown

## Session Rundown: Circle of Control

**1\. Check-In (5 min)**  
Quickly connect and see how the client is feeling.

**2\. Introduce (5 min)**  
Explain: “We can’t control others — only our own thoughts, actions, and choices.”

**3\. Activity (10 min)**  
Do the “What’s in My Control” exercise. Discuss what belongs inside or outside the circle.

**4\. Reflection (5 min)**  
Ask: “How does it feel to focus on what you *can* control?”

**5\. Closing (5 min)**  
End with the “Letting Go” statement:

“I release what isn’t mine to control.”

## Homework

## Homework: Circle of Control

1. **Notice & Name:**  
   Each day, write down one thing you tried to control that wasn’t yours to manage.  
2. **Refocus:**  
   Ask yourself: “What *is* in my control right now?”  
   Then take one small positive action (like setting a boundary, breathing, or walking away).  
3. **Letting Go Reminder:**  
   End your day by saying:  
   “I let go of what isn’t mine to control.”

A framework to help families focus their energy effectively. Circle of Control (Direct control):

Your actions and reactions.

Your healthy choices and communication.

Your self-care and decisions.

Key Message: Focus energy on what you can control, not what you can't.Application: Helps families stop trying to control their loved one's addiction and instead focus on their own responses and well-being.Exercise: Walk through creating your own circle of control. 

## 

## Use of “ I ” statements

Circle of Control & "I" Statements"I" statements fit directly into your Circle of Control because they focus on what you can control \- your own feelings, needs, and responses.How "I" Statements Stay in Your Control:

* "I feel worried when..." (your emotion)  
* "I need..." (your health choice)  
* "I will..." (your action/consequence)

### Examples:

Instead of: "You're destroying this family" (trying to control their shame/behavior)

Use: "I feel scared when I see you using drugs" (controlling your communication)

Instead of: "You need to get clean" (trying to control their recovery)

Use: "I will not give you money anymore" (controlling your actions)

Key Point: "I" statements keep you focused on expressing and managing your own experience rather than trying to change or control the other person's behavior or feelings. Result: You stay empowered by focusing on what you can actually influence \- how you communicate your own truth. Using “I” statements helps avoid power struggles within the family dynamic. 

## Healthy choice and invitation style

Healthy Choices (replaces "boundaries"): Making decisions that support your wellbeing rather than creating barriers.

Three-Step Process:

1\. **Outline Your Healthy Choice:** "I don't choose to be with you when you drink. "I choose not to give money when I suspect drug use."

2\. **Extend an Invitation:** "When you're sober, I'd love to spend time together. "I'm here to support your recovery efforts."

3\. **Invite Their Perspective:** "What are your thoughts on this?" "How do you see this working?" "What choices are you making for yourself?"

Why This Works Better:

"boundaries" can feel divisive and confrontational or seem like a form of punishment.

"Healthy choices" focuses on your self-care

Invitations maintain connection and hope

Asking for their perspective keeps communication open

Creates collaboration instead of opposition

Example: "I choose not to have alcohol in my home, and you're always welcome here when you're sober. What are your thoughts on this arrangement?"

## 

## Healthy Choices WITHOUT PUNISHMENT

There’s a difference between a punishment and a healthy choice.

Punishment says, *“You hurt me, so I’m going to hurt you back.”*

Healthy Choices say, *“I love you, and I love me—and this is what I need to stay well.”*

Families often confuse the two.

In the chaos of addiction, it’s easy to swing between extremes—either total enmeshment (*“I’ll do anything to keep you safe”*) or emotional exile (*“If you mess up again, I’m done with you forever”*).

But neither of those responses are healthy choices. One is fear. The other is fury.

Healthy choices don’t come from fear or fury. They come from *clarity and self-respect*.

A health choice isn’t about changing someone else. It’s about protecting your own integrity.

Your loved one may be learning to say no to a substance.

You may need to learn to say no to chaos.

That means you don’t need to control them.

You just need to be clear about *you*:

* What behavior you can tolerate and what you cannot.  
* What support you’re willing to give and what you’re not.  
* What conditions you need to remain safe, stable, and emotionally sober.

A health choice might sound like:

* “I love you, and I won’t engage with you when you’re high.”  
* “I’m here to talk, but I won’t be lied to.”  
* “You’re free to make your choices. I’m free to respond in a way that protects my peace peace.”

Hhealthy choices are not walls to shut people out. They are doors to protect what’s sacred inside.

And here’s the best part: healthy choices don’t require their permission. 

You don’t need to convince them or get their approval.

You’re allowed to honor yourself.

Not as punishment—but as practice.

Not as control—but as clarity.

Not because you’re angry—but because you’re healing.

# Module 2 \-  Why Addiction Feels Personal

## Key Objectives

| Client Takeaway | Coach Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| Addiction makes people act in ways that feel hurtful, but it’s not because they don’t care. It’s not personal, even though it feels that way. It’s about pain they don’t know how to handle, and substances become their way to cope. When you understand that, it can help you protect your heart, set healthy boundaries, and still hold space for healing — both for them and for yourself. | Help the family move from **hurt and blame → to understanding and acceptance** — creating space for compassion, boundaries, and healing. |
| Addiction feels personal because it hurts — but it’s not personal. Your loved one isn’t trying to hurt you. They’re in pain themselves. When you understand that, it becomes easier to respond with clarity, strength, and compassion — for them and for yourself. | It feels personal because you love them — but it’s the disease, not your relationship, that’s causing the hurt. |
| It *feels personal* because addiction affects the heart of relationships — but it’s *not actually personal.* The addiction changes how the person acts, not how they feel about their loved ones. | It’s okay that it feels personal — because love makes it personal. But when you understand it’s the addiction, not you, you can start to heal. |
| “I can accept that it feels personal, but it’s not about me. I can care without carrying the blame.” | Addiction feels personal because it touches the people we love most — but understanding what’s really happening brings freedom, not blame. |

# Module Description

# Module: Why Addiction Feels Personal

### Description:

This module helps clients understand why a loved one’s addiction can feel like a personal attack, even though it’s not. Families often feel hurt, rejected, or blamed by the behaviors that come with addiction. By learning that addiction is a disease — not a choice against them — clients begin to separate the person they love from the illness itself.

### Goals:

* Understand why addiction feels personal.  
* Learn that addiction is not about *you*.  
* Build compassion and reduce blame.  
* Focus on healthy emotional boundaries.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Why Addiction Feels Personal

### 1\. Feelings First

Write down how your loved one’s addiction makes you feel (hurt, angry, scared, rejected, etc.).  
Then ask yourself:

“Is this really about me — or about the disease?”

---

### 2\. Separate the Person from the Addiction

Make two columns:

* **My Loved One** (their true self — kind, funny, caring)  
* **The Addiction** (lies, anger, broken promises)  
  See the difference between the person and the illness.

---

### 3\. Power Statement Practice

Write a new truth to replace hurt thoughts, like:

“It feels personal, but it’s the addiction talking — not them.”

## Session Rundown

Explain: “Addiction often feels personal, but it’s not about you — it’s about the illness taking over the person’s choices.”

**3\. Activity (10–15 min)**  
Do the **‘Separate the Person from the Addiction’** exercise.  
Discuss what differences the client noticed.

**4\. Reflection (5 min)**  
Ask: “How does it change how you feel when you see it’s the disease, not the person?”

**5\. Closing (5 min)**  
End with the power statement:

“It feels personal, but it’s not about me — it’s the addiction.”

## Homework

## Homework: Why Addiction Feels Personal

**Notice Your Feelings:**  Each day, write down one moment when your loved one’s behavior felt personal.

**Pause & Reframe:**  Remind yourself:  “This is the addiction, not the person.”

**Reflect:**  End your day with one thing you *still love or appreciate* about your loved one — beyond the addiction.

When someone we love lies to us, steals from us, abandons us, or hurts us—we take it personally. How could we not?

Their actions feel like rejection. Their absence feels like betrayal. Their chaos feels like proof that we weren’t good enough, strong enough, worthy enough.

But here’s a hard and healing truth:

**Addiction isn’t about you.**

Even when it hurts you, it’s not *about* you.

Addiction is a disease of disconnection—a compulsive attempt to escape pain, fear, and shame. It hijacks the brain and rewires the nervous system. It turns people into survival machines, unable to see beyond their own craving.

When someone is in active addiction, they are not operating from their values. They’re operating from their wiring. And while that doesn’t excuse harm, it *does* explain it.

If you want to heal, you have to stop asking:

*Why did they do this to me?*

And start asking:

*What has this disease done to all of us?*

It’s natural to take things personally. But it’s powerful to step back and see the bigger picture.

What if their distance wasn’t rejection?

What if their rage wasn’t about you?

What if their silence wasn’t punishment?

What if they were just lost—and doing anything they could to avoid feeling it?

This isn’t about letting them off the hook.

It’s about letting yourself off the hook.

You didn’t cause this. You can’t control it. And you won’t cure it.

But you *can* heal.

And that healing begins when you stop carrying someone else’s shame.

## Powerlessness VS Helplessness

### Powerlessness:

"I can't control their addiction, but I can control my response."

Accepting limits while keeping your own power.  Leads to healthy choices and boundaries.

### Helplessness:

"I can't do anything about anything."

Giving up on yourself completely.  Leads to paralysis and victimization.

If my loved one cannot make a decision, then the family is “stuck”.

How to Use: When families say "I'm helpless," reframe to "You're powerless over their addiction, but you have power over your own choices."

Coaching Shift: Move families from "I can't do anything" to "I can't control them, but I can control me."

Step One of recovery begins with this brutal truth: “We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.”

For the addict, this is where the healing begins. Not with a promise to do better, but with the courage to tell the truth: I am not in control.

But here’s what’s often missed: this truth isn’t just for the person with the substance use disorder. It’s for the whole family.

You’ve been living in unmanageability too. Trying to make peace with chaos. Trying to reason with illness. Trying to love someone into changing. Trying to hold a family together with duct tape and prayer.

You’ve done everything in your power. And it still wasn’t enough. Not because you failed— But because you were never supposed to have that kind of power in the first place.

That’s what powerlessness really means. It’s not hopelessness. It’s humility. It’s the moment you stop trying to play God in someone else’s life—and start learning how to live your own again.

Admitting powerlessness doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means you’re strong enough to stop pretending you’re in control of things you never were.

This is where family recovery starts: With the courage to lay down your weapons. To stop fixing, managing, and monitoring. To breathe. To begin again—not with more effort, but with more surrender.

You don’t have to have a plan. You just have to tell the truth: This isn’t working. And let that truth open the door to something better.

# Module 3 \- Secrets in Addiction

## Key Objectives

| Client Takeaway | Coach Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| Addiction hides in secrets. Healing begins with truth. | As a coach, you can guide your client to see that secrets lose power when they’re shared. Healing starts with truth. |
| The client should be able to understand that addiction lives in secrets — but healing lives in honesty. | The coach can show the client that secrets keep addiction strong — but honesty makes recovery possible. |
| The client should have an awareness of addiction growing in secrecy, and that healing begins with awareness and truth. | The coach helps the client open up, face the truth, and find freedom from the weight of keeping secrets |

# Module Description

## Module: Secrets in Addiction

### Description:

This module helps clients understand how secrecy fuels addiction and harms trust within families. Addiction grows in silence — through lies, hiding, and shame. By bringing truth into the open, families begin healing and rebuilding honesty, safety, and connection.

### Goals:

* Understand how secrecy supports addiction.  
* Recognize how secrets create distance and distrust.  
* Learn that healing begins with honesty and openness.  
* Practice healthy, truthful communication.

## How Secrets Fuel Addiction:

* Keep the addict isolated and ashamed  
* Prevent them from getting help  
* Protect them from natural consequences  
* Enable continued destructive behavior

Family Secrets:

* Covering for missed work or events  
* Making excuses to friends and family  
* Hiding financial problems  
* Pretending everything is normal

Breaking the Silence:

* Share your truth with trusted people  
* Stop making excuses for their behavior  
* Let natural consequences occur  
* Seek support for yourself

Why Families Keep Secrets:

* Fear of judgment  
* Shame about the situation  
* Trying to protect the addicted person

Key Truth: Secrets keep everyone sick.

## 

## The Cost of Secrets

Every family system impacted by addiction develops rules—spoken or unspoken.  
One of the most common rules is: **“Don’t talk about it.”**

This silence may begin with good intentions: to protect someone’s privacy, to avoid embarrassment, or to hold the family together in the face of chaos. But over time, it stops being protective and starts being harmful.

**Secrecy is different from privacy.** Privacy is a boundary. Secrecy is a barrier.  
When we keep secrets out of fear, shame, or pressure, it isolates us—and makes real healing nearly impossible.

Many families hide addiction by minimizing the problem, lying to others, or avoiding difficult conversations altogether.  Children may be told not to talk about what’s happening at home.  
Spouses may keep up appearances at work, school, or church. Siblings may learn to ignore or deny their own emotions to avoid rocking the boat.

Over time, this creates deep emotional confusion.  People learn to mistrust their own instincts. They stop asking for help. And they internalize the message that the truth is dangerous.

But here’s the reality:  
**Secrets increase suffering for everyone.**   
They delay recovery. They feed shame. They prevent intimacy.  And they create long-term emotional consequences—especially for children.

Part of recovery, both for the addicted individual and for the family, involves learning to **tell the truth**—in safe, appropriate, and intentional ways.

That doesn’t mean putting all your personal business on display. It means learning when secrecy is hurting you—and choosing honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable.

This week, reflect on what you’ve kept hidden, and why.  Ask yourself: Who am I protecting? And what is the cost? Healing requires truth. And truth doesn’t have to be dramatic or loud.  
It can start with one clear sentence, spoken to one safe person.

The goal isn’t to broadcast your family’s pain.  The goal is to stop hiding from your own.

## Acceptance

There’s a kind of suffering that doesn’t come from what’s happening—it comes from what we *wish* were happening instead.

We replay old conversations. Rewrite different endings. Pretend things aren’t as bad as they are—or cling to the fantasy that if we just try harder, they’ll change.

That’s where addiction traps the family—not just in grief, but in *resistance to reality*.

Radical acceptance doesn’t mean you’re okay with what happened.  It means you’ve stopped arguing with what *is*.

It means looking directly at the truth without blinking:

* My loved one is addicted.  
* I can’t make them stop.  
* This has hurt me deeply.  
* It is not my job to hold the family together alone.

It’s not weak to accept reality. It’s strong. It’s sane. It’s the first step toward peace.  Because when you stop trying to change what’s already happened,  you start changing what happens next.

Radical acceptance is not agreement, approval, or surrender to hopelessness.  It’s saying: *“This is what’s real right now. And I choose to meet it with honesty, not illusion.”*

When we accept what’s real, we can stop rescuing, bargaining, or obsessing—and start responding with clarity, boundaries, and love.  You can’t heal what you’re still pretending isn’t there.  And you can’t grow when your energy is tied up in trying to control someone else’s story.

But you can start again—from here.

* From what’s true.  
* From what’s real.  
* From what’s now.

# Module Description

## Module: Expectations Are Our Demise

### Description:

This module helps clients understand how holding on to expectations — of others, of recovery, or of how life “should” be — leads to frustration, resentment, and disappointment. By learning to release expectations and focus on acceptance, clients can find peace and emotional freedom.

### Goals:

* Understand how expectations cause pain and conflict.  
* Learn the difference between **expectations** and **healthy hopes.**  
* Practice acceptance and flexibility.  
* Build peace through letting go of control.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Expectations Are Our Demise

### 1\. Spot the Expectation

Think of a recent time you felt upset or disappointed.  
Ask yourself:

“What expectation did I have that wasn’t met?”

---

### 2\. Shift to Acceptance

Write a new thought to replace the old one.  
Example:

“They should call me back” → “I can’t control others, but I can choose how I respond.”

---

### 3\. Letting Go Practice

Write down one expectation you want to release this week.  
Say out loud:

“I let go of what I can’t control and choose peace instead.”

**5\. Closing (5 min)**  
End with this affirmation:

“I release expectations and choose peace over control.

## Homework

### Homework: Expectations Are Our Demise

**Notice:**  This week, pay attention to when you feel disappointed or frustrated.

**Identify:**  Ask yourself:  “What expectation did I have in this moment?”

**Release:**  Say:  “I can’t control others. I choose acceptance and peace.”

**Reflect:**  Write down one situation where letting go helped you feel calmer.

How Expectations Set Us Up:

### Create Resentment:

* When our expectations aren't met, we feel angry and disappointed.  
* "They should appreciate my help," leads to bitterness when they don't.  
* We blame others for not meeting our unspoken standards.

### Remove Personal Power:

* We tie our happiness to other people's actions.  
* "I'll be happy when they get sober" puts our well-being in their hands.  
* We become victims of circumstances we can't control.

### Damage Relationships:

* Unmet expectations create conflict and tension.  
* We punish others for not reading our minds.  
* Focus shifts from love to disappointment.

### 

### Cause Suffering:

* The gap between expectation and reality creates pain.  
* We miss what is actually happening while focusing on what should happen.  
* Constant disappointment becomes our default state.

**Coaching Approach:** Help families identify hidden expectations and replace them with hopes, preferences, or healthy choices.

**Example:** Replace "They should call me back" (expectation) with "I hope they call, and I'll decide how to respond either way" (preference with personal power).

## Resentment and Expectations

If you’ve been living alongside addiction, chances are you’ve felt resentment.  Not because you’re unkind. But because you’ve been carrying more than your share for longer than anyone realizes.

Resentment doesn’t just come from being hurt—it comes from being disappointed.  And disappointment almost always begins with an unspoken expectation.

* We expect them to stop using.   
* We expect them to be grateful.  
* We expect them to change once we sacrifice enough.   
* We expect things to go back to “normal.”

And when they don’t—we hurt.

Here’s what recovery teaches:  
**Unmet expectations are the birthplace of resentment.**  And **resentment is the birthplace of relapse.**

In most recovery literature, resentment is named as the *\#1 offender.*

* Not the substance.   
* Not the trauma.   
* Not the chaos.   
* Not even guilt.

### Resentment

Because resentment doesn’t just poison one relationship—it poisons the entire system. It makes forgiveness impossible. It blocks intimacy. It fuels shame, blame, and disconnection.

If we want our families to heal—if we want recovery to actually work—we have to reduce the amount of resentment in the room. Not just *their* resentment toward us. *Ours* toward them.  
And ours toward each other.

That means releasing the expectations that keep us stuck:

* The expectation that they recover on your timeline  
* The expectation that people apologize exactly the way you want  
* The expectation that others will understand your pain without you expressing it  
* The expectation that anyone else can give you the peace you’ve denied yourself

This doesn’t mean you stop hoping.  It means you stop holding people hostage to your unspoken demands.

Because here’s the irony:  When you stop expecting them to change, you make space for *you* to change.   And that’s where freedom begins.

## Resentment as a Signal, Not a Sin

In many recovery circles, resentment is seen as dangerous—and it is.  

* It can fester.   
* It can block healing.   
* It can justify old behaviors.

But resentment is also something else: **a signal.**

Resentment is what we feel when a need goes unmet for too long—especially when we haven’t voiced that need, or we’ve been too afraid to honor it ourselves.

#### Resentment says:

* “I’m exhausted, and no one notices.”  
* “I keep giving, and I’m not getting anything back.”  
* “I said yes when I wanted to say no.”  
* “I’ve been holding this in for years.”

Resentment often shows up when our boundaries are weak, our expectations are unclear, or our own needs have been buried beneath someone else’s crisis.  It’s not a sin. It’s a signal.  It’s your soul’s way of telling you: *Something important is being neglected here.*

This week is about listening to that signal—not with shame, but with curiosity.

Ask yourself:

* What is my resentment trying to tell me?  
* Where have I been saying yes when I meant no?  
* What need have I ignored in myself while focusing on someone else?

You are not bad for feeling resentful. You are human.  And like all emotions, resentment doesn’t need to be acted out—but it does need to be understood.  The work of recovery is not to eliminate resentment by force.  It’s to uncover the truth beneath it—and respond with honesty, courage, and new choices.

# Module 5 \- Blocks

## Key Objectives

| Client Takeaway | Coach Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| The Client should understand the definitions of assumptions, interpretations, and limiting beliefs. | The coach can help the client distinguish between the three different types of blocks, and work through examples of each type. |
| The client should be able to understand the relationship between habits and blocks. | The coach can link these things in the client’s mind by reviewing habit progression, and probing the client about what may be stopping them. |
| The client should have an awareness of their existing assumptions, and limiting beliefs. | The coach can work through their homework, and, if necessary, push the client to go deeper. |
| The client should accept their blocks. | The coach should help their clients learn that they really can never be rid of blocks, but they may be able to repurpose them.  |

## Module Description

The Blocks Module is intended to help the client understand the complexity of adopting new habits, and forward motion. This can be very challenging work for the client because it involves introspection. This is a module that can often take 2-3 sessions.  The client learns about three basic types of blocks:

**Assumptions** \- Ideas that because something happened in the past, it will happen again in the future

**Interpretations** \- Stories we tell ourselves about what happened in the past which may or may not be true

**Limiting Beliefs** \- General ideas about how the world works which may or may not be true. 

These are all things that hold our client back, and if we want our client to grow, it’s vital that our client learn how to become aware of their blocks, and have a framework and language for discussing them.

## Module Exercises

**Blocks in Relationships** \- When blocked by a relationship, we have five options. 

1. Remain Blocked  
2. Leave  
3. Accept  
4. Change Our Perspective  
5. Change. 

Blocks are a normal part of life and part of the infinite game.

**Limiting Beliefs** \- Limiting beliefs are beliefs your client has about how the world works that limit their potential. The client is guided through an exercise of learning to name a limiting belief, exploring how true it is, and what it’s costing them. They’re asked what the payoff is for keeping the belief.  Clients can get dodgy here. So look out, and if you have to push for some straight answers, you should. They’re then asked if there’s a new belief they could replace it with.

**Interpretations** \- Interpretations are the stories we tell ourselves about an event or something specific in our experience. Clients are asked to explain what happened and to come up with an “observer view” — like what would an alien say happened. They’re then asked what the difference between their view and the observer view, and to come up with three different interpretations of what happened.

**Assumptions** \-  Assumptions are beliefs that because something happened in the past, it will eventually happen again in the future. Assumptions tend to have the words “always” or “never” attached to them. The client is asked to name three people whose thinking they trust that they can go to to challenge their assumptions. They’re then asked to write down 10 rules of life that they’ve learned through their experience and to go through them with their coach.

## Session Rundown

Begin by working through the client’s limiting beliefs for each of the participating family members. This tends to be where the client spends the bulk of time in a session. Clients tend to have a common limiting belief: “I’m not enough” or “I’m not good enough” (or some variant) — if this is the case: 

### COMBATING IMPOSTER SYNDROME

1. Let them know how common this is amongst the CVC Alumni community  
2. Point out the evolutionary standpoint here — who would be more likely to reproduce 2,000 years ago, the person who believed they have done enough for the tribe, or the person who always believed that they could always do more (we’re bred for that feeling)  
3. And so with many of these limiting beliefs, but especially this one, it’s not about doing more and more and waiting for that feeling to go away. It’s instead about accepting that the feeling is always going to be there. We change from “I’m not good enough” to “I get to grow.”

###  PERFECTIONISM

1. Share with the client that perfectionism is a popular thought pattern amongst our participants.  
2. Help the client understand this by asking how often guilt and shame come up for them when things aren’t perfect.  
3. What are we willing to do to avoid criticism and blame?   
4. How have we used our focus to avoid criticism and blame?  
5. Like the impostor syndrome, point out the evolutionary standpoint here — who would be more likely to reproduce 2,000 years ago, the person who believed they had done enough for the tribe or the person who always thought that they could always do better?  
6. And so with many of these limiting beliefs, but especially this one, it’s not about doing more and more and waiting for that feeling to go away. It’s instead about accepting that the feeling is always going to be there. We change from “I’m not good enough” to “I get to grow.”

You’ll want to review each of the client’s identified blocks and help the client understand that block discovery is a lifelong process. 

There is also a chance that the client did not understand or avoided the work. This also may be an opportunity to discover a block\! If that’s the case, share your own experience with blocks and take the client through each one during the session.

Spend the last few minutes in inquiry: 

* Where are you getting blocked in your work right now?  
  * In reflecting on our past work together, where do you think you’re blocked  
    * What assumptions or interpretations in your story have really been holding you back?  
    * What in your life supports your ability to change your habits?  
    * If you could change just one of these blocks to something else, what would it be?  
    * What’s the opposite of that belief?

If you’re following the traditional pathway, it is recommended that you do a client-led session as your next session after this session. Spend a few minutes preparing your client for the client-led session so they come to the next session with something to work on.

## Homework

* The client should write down their core values on a new piece of paper daily and put it in their pocket.   
* The client should think about what they want to discuss in their open session.  
* The client should look for blocks and write them down.   
* The client should continue their daily practice  
* If open to it, the client should begin doing 5 minutes of guided meditation daily via Headspace, Calm, YouTube, or whatever they select. 

# Module 6 \- Core Values

## Key Objectives

| Client Takeaway | Coach Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| The Client Should Know Their 5 Core Values. And they should be able to express them to you. | The Coach should write down and get to know the client’s Core Values. |
| The client should have a working definition of practical spirituality. | The Coach should (if permission is granted) share their own story with core values. |
| The client should be committed to playing an “Infinite Game.” | The Coach should begin to discover and understand some the client’s story. |

##  Module Description

The Core Values module sets the table for the rest of the sessions – it is the heart and soul of the curriculum and must be done first, as all other sessions draw from it. This module helps the client understand the choice between values and comfort, explains how they got into the predicament of needing recovery in the first place, and gives the client and coach the opportunity to find peer connection.

## *![][image3]* 

## Module Exercises

**Practical Spirituality**—The client is introduced to the idea of practical spirituality, which states that our connection to any higher power is based on the proximity of our actions to our values.

**Core Value Selection** \- The Client is asked to identify the core values they relate to and the core values from which their focus has separated them. Usually, clients report being removed from almost all their values. 

**The Spiritual Pyramid** \- The client is introduced to the core values pyramid. 

**Finite vs. Infinite Games** \- The client is introduced to the concept of finite vs. infinite games and the fact that recovery is an infinite game.

## Session Rundown

Ask the client what challenged them in this week’s work. If they didn’t do the work, spend 10-15 minutes of the session going through the work with them, giving the client time to complete the core values discovery process, introducing them verbally to the concept of practical spirituality, and committing them to the infinite game.

* Once you have discovered the client’s core values, praise those values.  
* Ask them about their spirituality and how their values connect with their spirituality.  
* If appropriate and valuable to the client, ask the client if you can share a story of your own discovery of values and spirituality. If they say yes, spend at most 2-3 minutes sharing your story with them. Ask if it resonates with them.  
* Ask the client what they think about finite vs. infinite games and if there are any places in their lives where an infinite game mindset might be beneficial.  
* Spend the last 10 minutes of the session with the client in discussion.

Here are some questions you can ask to help the client uncover insight:

* What experiences are available to you if you’re rooted in your values?  
* In what ways have you noticed your energy and confidence levels change when you act in alignment with your core values?  
* What have your values cost you?  
* What does faith mean to you?  
* Share about the importance of faith in values in your life  
* How can turning towards your values instead of comfort help you grow through stressful, anxious, or pressured situations?  
* Considering the concept of finite and infinite games, how can viewing your recovery as an 'infinite game' transform your approach to challenges and setbacks?  
* Which common trap of viewing recovery as a finite game resonates with you the most, and why?  
* How do you define success in recovery?  
* How might a heightened awareness of your values influence your decision-making going forward?

*With ten minutes remaining:*

Introduce the **Power of the Pause** module. Give a brief overview of what is required, and what to expect regarding a time commitment. 

* Ask your client what their plan is to stay in recovery.  
* Work with the client to find realistic and honest answers.  
* Assign the client their homework and the next module.  
* Ask what support or resources they need to accomplish their weekly work and commitments.  
* Ask how they would like to close the session

##  Homework

* The client should write down their core values on a new piece of paper daily and put it in their pocket.   
* The client should do the Committee Thinking Homework  
* If open to it, the client should begin doing 5 minutes of guided meditation daily via Headspace, Calm, YouTube, or whatever they select. 

## Surrender: What does it mean?

What Does It Mean to Surrender Surrender Is:

Accepting what you cannot control

Releasing the need to fix someone else

Letting go of forcing outcomes

Focusing on your actions, not theirs

Surrender Is NOT:

Giving up or quitting

Being passive

Enabling destructive behavior

Abandoning your loved one

What It Looks Like: "I love you and I can't save you"

Set healthy choices without controlling outcomes

Care without carrying their responsibilities

Detach with love, not from love

The Paradox: When you stop trying to control everything, you gain more peace and influence.For Families: Love your addicted family member while accepting you cannot make them get sober \- only they can choose recovery.

If love were enough, they’d have gotten better a long time ago..

You’ve tried everything—negotiated, begged, reasoned, warned, pleaded, protected. Maybe you’ve monitored their texts, Googled symptoms, covered for them at work, or stayed up late waiting for them to come home. Maybe you’ve cried in secret and smiled in public.

That’s not weakness.

That’s what people do when they’re scared and they love someone.

But here’s what recovery teaches—first to the addict, and then to the family:

**You didn’t cause this. You can’t control it. And you can’t cure it.**

For your loved one, recovery begins when they surrender to their powerlessness over drugs, alcohol, or whatever they’ve used to escape.

For you, recovery begins when you surrender to your powerlessness over *them.*

It’s the same principle. Different object, Same freedom.

When they stop trying to manage the substance, they begin to find peace.

When you stop trying to manage *them*, you begin to find yours.

Control is seductive—it looks like love, sounds like care, and feels like safety.

But it’s a trap. It creates anxiety, resentment, and burnout.

And it keeps you stuck in their story… instead of writing your own.

Letting go doesn’t mean giving up. It means going on vacation. It means letting go. 

It means shifting your focus from *them* to *you*:

* From obsessing about their relapse to honoring your own emotional sobriety.  
* From micromanaging their recovery to showing up for your own.  
* From rescuing them from consequences to respecting their dignity.

Letting go is not abandonment.

It’s alignment.

It’s love that tells the truth.

Because you deserve peace too.

And peace doesn’t come from control.

It comes from surrender.

# Module Description

## Module: Power of the Pause

### Description:

This module teaches clients the importance of slowing down before reacting. The “pause” gives space to breathe, think, and respond calmly instead of reacting out of fear, anger, or emotion. Learning to pause helps create better communication, emotional control, and healthier choices in recovery and relationships.

### Goals:

* Understand the value of pausing before reacting.  
* Practice using the pause to calm emotions.  
* Learn how the pause improves communication and connection.  
* Build self-awareness and emotional control.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Power of the Pause

### 1\. Practice the Pause

Think of a situation that usually triggers you.  
Next time it happens, **pause**, take a deep breath, and count to five before responding.  
Afterward, reflect:

“What changed when I paused first?”

---

### 2\. Pause Journal

Each day, note one moment when you paused instead of reacting.  
Write what you felt and how the outcome was different.

---

### 3\. Pause Phrase

Choose a calming phrase to repeat during stressful moments, like:

“Breathe first.” or “Respond, don’t react.”  
Use it whenever you feel triggered.

## Session Rundown

## Session Rundown: Power of the Pause

**1\. Check-In (5 min)**  
Ask how the client is feeling and if they’ve noticed any moments of reacting quickly this week.

Explain: “The pause gives us space to think before we react. It’s a simple tool that helps us respond with calm instead of emotion.”

**3\. Activity (10–15 min)**  
Do the **‘Practice the Pause’** exercise.  
Discuss what it feels like to stop and breathe before responding.

**4\. Reflection (5 min)**  
Ask: “What did you notice happens when you give yourself space to pause?”

**5\. Closing (5 min)**  
End with this affirmation:

“In the pause, I find my power.”

**Homework**

## Homework: Power of the Pause

**Notice:**  This week, pay attention to moments when you feel triggered or emotional.

**Pause:**  Take a deep breath before reacting — count to five or step away if needed.

**Reflect:**  At the end of each day, write one moment when pausing changed the outcome.

**Affirm:**  Say to yourself:  “Every pause gives me power and peace.”

The Pause: Stop and ask: "Is this a good time for this conversation?"

When NOT to Engage:

* They are under the influence  
* You are emotionally triggered  
* They are defensive or hostile  
* You're trying to control the outcome

When TO Engage:

* Both parties are calm and sober  
* You can stay in your Circle of Control  
* You're sharing healthy choices (not demanding change)  
* They seem open or ask for help

How to Use:

* Check your emotional state first  
* Ask: "What am I trying to accomplish?"  
* Choose your response instead of reacting

Key Principle: Timing and emotional state matter more than your words. Give yourself permission to pause.

## Rupture and Repair as a Family Practice

In families affected by addiction, conflict often carries a heavy weight.  
Maybe it meant yelling. Silence. Disconnection.  
Maybe it meant someone leaving—and not coming back.  
So we learn to avoid conflict. To stuff it down. To pretend everything’s okay.

But healthy families don’t avoid rupture.  **They learn how to repair.**

Rupture happens in every relationship—recovery or not.  
It might be a sharp word, a broken promise, a defensive moment, a forgotten boundary.

The difference isn’t whether rupture happens.  It’s whether there’s a pathway back.

Repair is how we rebuild trust.  
Not through perfection, but through presence.  
Not through performance, but through ownership.

Here are a few examples of taking ownership.  

It sounds like:

* “I didn’t handle that well. I’m sorry.”  
* “I want to understand what happened between us.”  
* “I can see how that hurt you.”  
* “What would help rebuild trust here?”  
* “Can we try again?”

It takes humility to go first.  It takes courage to respond with softness when everything in you wants to defend.  But this is how families grow.

When you make rupture and repair *normal*, you stop treating every mistake like a disaster.  
You stop needing to be perfect.  You start learning how to be real.

This week, don’t fear the rupture.  
See it as a doorway.  
To intimacy. To healing. To practice.

# Module Description

## Module: Responding vs. Reacting

### Description:

This module helps clients understand the difference between reacting out of emotion and responding with thought and calm. Reacting is quick and often fueled by fear or anger, while responding is thoughtful and based on choice. Learning to respond instead of react builds emotional balance, healthy communication, and stronger relationships.

### Goals:

* Understand the difference between reacting and responding.  
* Learn how emotions influence reactions.  
* Practice pausing before responding.  
* Build healthier communication and emotional control.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Responding vs. Reacting

### 1\. Spot the Difference

Think of a recent situation where you reacted quickly.  
Ask yourself:

“What might have changed if I paused and responded instead?”

---

### 2\. React or Respond Chart

Make two columns:

* **Reacting:** quick, emotional, defensive  
* **Responding:** calm, thoughtful, balanced  
  Write examples from your own life in each column.

---

### 3\. Practice the Pause

Next time you feel triggered, stop and take one deep breath before speaking.  
Afterward, reflect:

“Did my response feel calmer or clearer?”

## Session Rundown

**1\. Check-In (5 min)**  
Ask how the client has been handling emotional situations this week.

**2\. Introduce (5 min)**  
Explain: “Reacting is quick and emotional. Responding is calm and thoughtful. The difference can change how we communicate and connect.”

**3\. Activity (10–15 min)**  
Do the **‘React or Respond Chart’** exercise.  
Discuss examples of each and how it feels to respond instead of react.

**4\. Reflection (5 min)**  
Ask: “What helps you slow down and choose a response instead of a reaction?”

**5\. Closing (5 min)**  
End with this affirmation:

“I choose to respond with calm, not react with emotion.”

**Homework**

## Homework: Responding vs. Reacting

1. **Notice:**  
   This week, pay attention to moments when you react quickly.  
2. **Pause:**  
   Before responding, take one deep breath and count to three.  
3. **Reflect:**  
   At the end of the day, write down one time you responded calmly instead of reacting.  
4. **Affirm:**  
   Say to yourself:  
   “I can’t control others, but I can control my response.”

Reacting:

Immediate, emotional, automatic

Driven by fear, anger, or panic

Often makes situations worse

No pause or thought involved

"You're destroying this family\!"

Responding:

Thoughtful, intentional, chosen

Driven by your values and healthy choices

Considers consequences before speaking

Includes a pause to think

"I feel scared when I see you using drugs."

How to Shift from Reacting to Responding:

Use the power of the pause

Take a breath before speaking

Ask: "What outcome do I want?"

Stay in your Circle of Control

Choose words that reflect your values

Key Difference: Reactions happen TO you; responses come FROM you.

Example:

React: "You're lying again\!" (emotional, automatic)

Respond: "I don't choose to continue this conversation when I feel you're not being honest" (thoughtful and healthy choice)

## Saying What’s True (Without Drama)

In families affected by addiction, communication often becomes reactive, indirect, or emotionally loaded.  
People either hold back what they’re really feeling—or say it in a way that causes more harm than clarity.

We do this because we’re scared.  
Scared of being misunderstood.  
Scared of setting someone off.  
Scared of what will happen if we’re honest.

But without truth, there’s no trust.  
And without trust, there’s no real recovery.

This week is about learning how to **say what’s true—without drama.**

That means:

- Speaking from your values, not your triggers  
- Using calm, direct language instead of sarcasm, blame, or silence  
- Letting go of the need to convince, control, or protect others from discomfort  
- Saying what’s real, even if your voice shakes

For example:

- Instead of “You never listen to me,” try: “I feel dismissed when I don’t feel heard.”  
- Instead of “Whatever, forget it,” try: “This is important to me, and I’d like to come back to it when we’re both calm.”  
- Instead of “I guess I’m just the bad guy,” try: “I’m setting this boundary because it matters to my recovery.”

Speaking the truth doesn’t mean starting a fight.  
It means honoring your experience.  
And it requires two things: **courage and clarity.**

The more you practice honest, values-based communication, the more safety you create in the family system. Not because everyone agrees—but because everyone knows where you stand, and that you’re not hiding.

Truth-telling is one of the greatest gifts you can give to your recovery.  
It takes work. But it’s worth it.

# Module Description

## Module: Love vs. Enabling

### Description:

This module helps clients understand the difference between showing real love and enabling unhealthy behavior. Love supports recovery and responsibility, while enabling protects the addiction. Learning this difference helps families set healthy boundaries, show compassion without rescuing, and support lasting change.

### Goals:

* Understand the difference between loving and enabling.  
* Recognize how enabling keeps addiction going.  
* Learn how to love with boundaries.  
* Practice supportive, healthy actions.

## Module Exercises

## Module Exercises: Love vs. Enabling

### 1\. Spot the Difference

Think of a recent situation where you helped your loved one.  
Ask yourself:

“Was this love — or was I enabling?”  
Love helps them grow.  
Enabling protects them from consequences.

---

### 2\. Two Columns

Make two lists:

* **Love:** honest, supportive, sets boundaries.  
* **Enabling:** rescuing, covering up, fixing.  
  Write one example of each from your own experience.

---

### 3\. Practice Healthy Love

Choose one small way to show love this week without enabling —  
like saying “no” kindly or letting your loved one face a consequence.

## Session Rundown

**HomeworK**

## Homework: Love vs. Enabling

1. **Notice:**  
   This week, pay attention to moments when you feel the urge to “fix” or rescue your loved one.  
2. **Pause:**  
   Ask yourself:  
   “Is this helping them grow — or keeping them stuck?”  
3. **Choose Love:**  
   Practice one healthy action that shows real love, like setting a boundary or saying no with kindness.  
4. **Affirm:**  
   Say to yourself:  
   “Real love allows others to face their truth.”

Love:

Sets healthy choices and follows through

Allows natural consequences

Supports recovery, not addiction

"I love you and won't fund your addiction."

Enabling:

Removes consequences of their choices

Rescues them from problems

Makes excuses or covers for them

"I love you, so I'll fix this for you."

Key Question: Am I helping them get better or helping them stay sick?

Examples:

Love: "I won't give you money, but I'll drive you to treatment."

Enabling: "Here's money so you won't be homeless" (knowing they'll use drugs)

Remember: Sometimes the most loving thing is the hardest thing to do.

Exercise: Practice showing love vs enabling. Share examples from the past and how you would approach them without enabling. (Roleplay)

## Co-Dependency vs. Interdependency

When you love someone in addiction, it’s easy to lose the line between where *you* end and *they* begin.

You may find yourself constantly scanning for danger.  
Trying to manage their emotions.  
Sacrificing your own needs to avoid conflict.  
Measuring your worth by how “helpful” or “needed” you are.

That’s not connection.  
That’s **co-dependency.**

Co-dependency happens when your sense of identity, safety, or self-worth becomes tied to another person’s behavior, emotions, or approval. **Co-dependency means not knowing where you end, and someone else begins.**  
It often comes from a good place—love, protection, responsibility—but over time, it creates exhaustion, resentment, and burnout.

**Interdependency** is something different.

Interdependency means you can be close to someone without losing yourself.  
It means both people take responsibility for their own emotions, needs, and boundaries.  
It allows for mutual support—not one person saving the other.

In an interdependent relationship:

- You can ask for what you need without guilt.  
- You can say no without punishment.  
- You can love someone without trying to control them.  
- You can offer help without abandoning yourself.

This week is about looking honestly at your patterns.  
Where have you been over-functioning?  
Where have you abandoned your own needs to take care of someone else?  
And what would it look like to move from co-dependency to interdependency?

You are allowed to be connected.  
You are allowed to be needed.  
But you are not required to disappear in the process.

## Detachment with Love

When someone we love is suffering, it feels wrong to pull away.

We think love means being all in—fixing, rescuing, worrying, tracking, checking in, checking up. We call it loyalty. We call it care.

But when love gets entangled with fear, we stop helping—and start hovering.

We stop supporting—and start controlling.

We stop showing up as ourselves—and start disappearing into their crisis.

**Detachment** is how we return to ourselves without abandoning them.

It doesn’t mean we stop loving.

It means we stop *losing* ourselves in their disease.

You’re not here to save them.

You’re here to be a safe place—not a soft landing for consequences, but a stable presence grounded in truth, compassion, and limits.

Your loved one is in a process. They may be growing. They may relapse. They may get better and fall again. That is not a reflection of your love—it’s a reflection of their path.

**Detachment with love says:**

* *“I care about you, but I won’t carry you.”*  
* *“I trust your process, even if I don’t like what it looks like right now.”*  
* *“I’m learning to hold my peace, no matter what’s happening around me.”*

To detach is to return to your rightful place.

Not at the center of their story—but at the center of your own.

You’re allowed to have joy while they struggle.

You’re allowed to set boundaries and still care.

You’re allowed to protect your peace without punishing them.

And when they see you doing that—modeling emotional sobriety, choosing clarity over chaos, offering love without strings—they’ll witness something powerful:

A new way to live.

## Grief That Doesn’t Have a Funeral

Grief is usually associated with death.  
But for families impacted by addiction, the deepest grief often comes from losses that no one sees or names.

You may be grieving:

- The version of your loved one that used to laugh, show up, or feel present  
- The family you thought you’d have  
- The childhood you didn’t get to fully live  
- The years lost to chaos, fear, or walking on eggshells  
- The relationship you hoped would heal by now

This kind of grief is called **ambiguous loss**—grief without a clear beginning or end.  
It’s the ache of loving someone who is physically present but emotionally unavailable.  
Or the heartbreak of moving forward while part of you still hopes it could have been different.

In recovery, grief doesn’t go away just because things get better.  
Sometimes, when the crisis calms, the sadness actually surfaces.

That doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.  
It means you’re finally safe enough to feel.

Grief is not a problem to solve. It’s a process to allow.  
It’s your heart telling the truth about what mattered.  
And it deserves time, space, and compassion.

This week is an invitation to name what you’ve lost—and to let that naming be part of your healing.

You don’t need permission to grieve.  
You don’t need a funeral to say goodbye.  
You just need a little willingness to feel what’s real.

# COACHING RESOURCES

# Building Trust as a Family Recovery Coach

## Listen First

**No judgment or immediate advice.** Resist the urge to jump into problem-solving mode or offer solutions before fully understanding the family's unique situation. Families affected by addiction have often experienced judgment from others—friends, extended family, even healthcare providers. When you withhold judgment and advice-giving in the initial stages, you demonstrate that this coaching relationship will be different. Let silence be comfortable. Allow families to finish their thoughts completely, even when the stories are painful or circular. Your restraint in offering immediate solutions communicates that you trust their capacity to find their own answers with support.  We call this practicing the “power of the pasue”.

**Validate their experience and pain.** Acknowledge the reality of what families are living through without minimizing or rushing to find silver linings. Statements like "This sounds absolutely exhausting" or "What you're describing takes tremendous strength to navigate" help families feel seen. Remember that validation doesn't require you to agree with every choice they've made—it simply affirms that their emotional experience is real and understandable given their circumstances. Many family members have been told they're "overreacting," "too controlling," or "enabling," which creates shame and isolation. Your validation can be deeply healing.

**Use their language, not clinical terms.** Pay attention to how families describe their experiences and mirror that language back to them. If a mother says her daughter is "using again," don't correct her by saying "experiencing a recurrence." If a father describes feeling "stuck," explore what "stuck" means to him rather than reframing it as "ambivalent" or "resistant to change." Clinical language can create distance and make families feel like subjects of study rather than partners in the coaching process. Using their own words builds rapport and demonstrates that you're truly listening, not filtering their experience through your professional framework.

## Establish Trust

**Be transparent about your role**. From the very first conversation, clearly articulate what coaching is and isn't. Explain that you're not a therapist, treatment provider, or someone who will tell them what to do. Help families understand that your role is to support them in clarifying their own values, setting boundaries that work for them, and navigating the complex emotions that arise when someone they love struggles with addiction. Discuss the structure of coaching—how often you'll meet, what they can expect from sessions, and how you'll work together. This transparency reduces anxiety and helps families know what to expect, which is especially important for people whose lives have become unpredictable due to addiction.

**Follow through on commitments.** Do exactly what you say you'll do, when you say you'll do it. If you promise to send a resource, send it that day. If you schedule a follow-up call, show up on time. If you need to reschedule, give as much notice as possible and offer alternatives immediately. Families living with addiction have often experienced broken promises from their loved ones—plans cancelled, commitments forgotten, trust repeatedly violated. Your consistency becomes a model of reliability and demonstrates that not everyone in their life will let them down. Even small follow-throughs build credibility and show that you take the coaching relationship seriously.

**Maintain confidentiality.** Be explicit about the boundaries of confidentiality and honor them rigorously. Families need to know that what they share with you stays with you (within legal and ethical limits). In family systems where secrets, triangulation, and divided loyalties are common, your commitment to confidentiality creates a rare space where they can be completely honest. Never share information from one family member with another unless you have explicit permission to do so. Be mindful of what you discuss in supervision or consultation, always protecting identifying information. When families trust that their stories are safe with you, they can explore the messy, complicated truth of their experiences.

## Create Safety

**Normalize their feelings.** Help families understand that their complex, sometimes contradictory emotions are natural responses to an unnatural situation. It's normal to feel both love and rage toward someone struggling with addiction. It's normal to oscillate between hope and despair, between wanting to help and wanting to walk away. Many family members feel ashamed of their anger, guilt about their resentment, or confused by their own ambivalence. When you normalize the full range of their emotional experience, you give them permission to be human. Share that other families you've worked with have felt similar things. This reduces isolation and shame, which are barriers to healing and growth.

**Avoid blame for past decisions.** Family members often carry tremendous guilt about what they "should have" done differently—enforcing consequences sooner, setting boundaries earlier, recognizing warning signs faster. Blaming themselves or being blamed by others keeps them stuck in the past and unable to move forward. Your role is to help them focus on the choices available to them now, not to dissect every decision that led to this moment. If family members bring up past regrets, acknowledge their pain while gently redirecting: "It sounds like you wish you had known then what you know now. Given what you're learning, what feels most important to you moving forward?" This orientation toward the present and future creates possibility rather than paralysis.

**Respect their pace.** Change happens in its own time, and families cannot be rushed into readiness they don't genuinely feel. Some family members will want to implement boundaries immediately; others will need months to build up to a single conversation. Some will be ready to disengage from enabling patterns right away; others will need to experiment and experience the consequences of continuing old patterns before they're ready to try something new. Pushing families faster than they're ready to go damages trust and can cause them to retreat. Instead, trust the process. Ask questions like "What feels like the next right step for you?" or "What would need to be true for you to feel ready to try that?" Meeting families at their actual readiness level, not where you wish they were, is an act of profound respect.

## Show Competence

**Ask informed questions.** Demonstrate your knowledge of addiction and family systems through the quality of your questions rather than lengthy explanations of what you know. Questions like "How has the unpredictability of his using patterns affected your ability to make plans?" or "What role do you notice yourself playing when the family system feels chaotic?" show that you understand the dynamics families face. Your questions should reveal insight into enabling, codependency, triangulation, boundary violations, and the impact of addiction on family roles—without needing to lecture about these concepts. When families sense that you truly understand the terrain they're navigating, they relax and open up.

**Provide practical guidance.** While coaching is not about giving advice, it does involve sharing tools, frameworks, and practical strategies that families can adapt to their unique situations. This might include communication techniques for talking with someone who's using, scripts for setting boundaries, resources for understanding the recovery process, or frameworks for making difficult decisions. The key is offering these tools as options rather than prescriptions: "Some families I've worked with have found it helpful to... Would that be something you'd want to explore?" Practical guidance demonstrates that you bring real value to the coaching relationship, not just empathy and good questions.

**Demonstrate addiction knowledge.** Show that you understand the nature of addiction as a chronic, relapsing condition that affects brain function, behavior, and relationships. Help families understand concepts like tolerance, withdrawal, the hijacked reward system, and the difference between wanting to stop and being able to stop. Explain how addiction operates in family systems, creating patterns of enabling, rescuing, and role distortion. When families see that you grasp the complexity of what they're facing—that you understand addiction is not a moral failing or a choice—they trust that you can help them navigate it. However, share this knowledge responsively, when it's relevant to their immediate concerns, rather than delivering it as educational content for its own sake.

## Build Alliance

**Focus on their goals, not your agenda. You** may see clearly what a family needs to do, but unless they want to do it, your clarity is irrelevant. Effective coaching requires you to set aside your own ideas about what would be best and become genuinely curious about what matters most to the family. Ask explicitly: "What would you most like to be different?" "What matters most to you in this situation?" "What would success look like for you?" Then align your coaching to support their goals, even if those goals are more modest or different than what you might choose. When families feel that you're working toward their desired outcomes rather than imposing your own vision, they engage more fully and take ownership of the process.

**Collaborate on solutions**. Position yourself as a partner in problem-solving rather than an expert with all the answers. Use language like "Let's explore this together" or "I'm wondering what might work for you" rather than "You should" or "The best thing to do is." Invite families to brainstorm options, evaluate pros and cons, and make their own decisions. When families generate their own solutions with your support, they're far more likely to implement them. Even when you have strong ideas, offer them tentatively: "I have a thought about this—would you like to hear it?" This collaborative stance honors family members as the experts on their own lives while positioning you as a knowledgeable guide.

**Celebrate progress.** In the chaos of addiction, families often lose sight of their own growth and resilience. They focus on what's not working, what their loved one is still doing, and how far there is yet to go. Your job is to notice and name progress, no matter how small. "You said that conversation without getting defensive—that's new for you." "Three weeks ago, you couldn't imagine setting that boundary, and now you've done it." "You're learning to sit with your anxiety instead of rushing to fix everything—that takes real courage." Celebrating progress builds momentum, reinforces change, and helps families recognize their own capacity. It also balances the heaviness of the work with moments of acknowledgment and hope.

## Key Principle

**Meet families where they are, not where you think they should be.**

This is the foundational principle that underlies all trust-building in family addiction coaching. It requires you to release your attachment to outcomes, timelines, and your own ideas about what constitutes progress. It asks you to honor that families are doing the best they can with the resources, knowledge, and emotional capacity they have in each moment. Meeting families where they are means accepting that a mother may not be ready to stop bailing her daughter out of jail, that a father may need to maintain his enabling patterns until the pain of continuing exceeds the fear of changing, that siblings may need to stay enmeshed until they develop other sources of identity and purpose.

Your role is not to drag families toward health faster than they can sustain, but to walk alongside them as they find their own path forward. This principle asks you to trust the timing of growth, to believe that people change when they're ready, and to offer support without attachment to whether or when they take it. When you truly meet families where they are, you create the conditions for trust—and trust is the foundation upon which all meaningful change is built.

## The Role of the Core Values family recovery coach

The coach guides families through this three-stage journey by:

1. Teaching the 10 modules as tools for understanding and change  
2. Building safety through validation, empowerment questions, and buy-in  
3. Staying in their lane (coach, not therapist, sponsor, or decision-maker)  
4. Modeling the framework through ethical practice and values alignment  
5. Supporting without rescuing (helping families find their own answers)  
6. Recognizing warning signs and escalating to appropriate resources when needed  
7. Celebrating progress while remaining realistic about ongoing challenges  
8. Maintaining professional healthy choices while offering authentic connection

The coach's mantra: "Meet families where they are, not where you think they should be. Guide them toward their values. Trust their wisdom. Hold their hope. Stay true to your own recovery and values."

# Family Case Study: A System in Crisis

This case study, *A System in Crisis*, serves as our shared reference point throughout this training. It allows us to step inside a living system—a family in active dysfunction and distress—and observe how patterns, roles, and relationships interact around the Pivot Person. By working with this case, we create a consistent example to explore the principles of Core Values Coaching in a dynamic and realistic way.

Each participant in the training will be assigned a role within the family system. Depending on the size of the group, not every role may be filled, but the story will still unfold through interaction and guided facilitation. The purpose of this exercise is not to “fix” the family, but to *see* the family—to recognize how beliefs, emotions, and coping strategies ripple through each relationship.

As you engage in your assigned role, remember that your goal is to embody the perspective and emotional landscape of that family member, not to judge or solve. Through roleplay, reflection, and discussion, you’ll learn to identify where the system is in the recovery journey—Landing, Stabilization, or Optimization—and how a coach can help each member make healthy choices that support collective growth.

This case is meant to stretch your awareness and deepen your compassion. The dynamics you’ll encounter here mirror what many families experience in real life: love tangled with fear, help intertwined with harm, and hope fighting to take root amid chaos. By walking through this case together, we practice what it means to shepherd a family through a crisis with steadiness, clarity, and heart.

## The Addict: 28-Year-Old Daughter

The daughter, now 28 years old, has been struggling with substance use disorder since early adolescence. Her family first noticed increased drinking when she was just 13 years old, and the progression of her addiction was rapid and severe. By the time she was 17, she had already received two DUI convictions, marking the beginning of a pattern that would continue into adulthood.

Despite multiple attempts at treatment—having attended three different rehabilitation facilities—she has left each program against medical advice (AMA). A significant complicating factor in her recovery is her access to a financial trust that the family cannot control, which has enabled her continued substance use while simultaneously making it difficult for her to support herself in healthy ways. Her addiction has profoundly affected her relationships with family members, whom she regularly triangulates against one another. When actively using, she communicates through anger, blame, and outbursts, creating chaos within the family system. She frequently reaches out to her sister for financial assistance, perpetuating a cycle of dependency and enabling.

## The Mother

The mother, who is divorced, brings her own complex history to the family dynamic, having been raised in a family affected by addiction. Her parenting approach, informed by her past experiences, creates tension within the family and builds resentment, particularly with her ex-husband. She maintains a rigid routine in an attempt to create structure and stability, but finds herself oscillating between fierce protection of her daughter and making firm, healthy choices about boundaries.

Her boundaries are clear: she refuses to give money directly to her daughter and will not allow drug use in her home. She has demonstrated her commitment to these boundaries by calling the police when necessary. Despite the heartbreak of watching her daughter struggle, she actively researches and provides information about treatment centers. Seeking support for herself, she regularly attends Al-Anon meetings and family therapy sessions, recognizing that she needs help navigating this difficult situation.

## The Father

The father's approach to his daughter's addiction is heavily influenced by guilt stemming from the divorce. Though well-meaning, his actions are often misguided, driven by a desperate need to maintain a relationship with his daughter at any cost. He has become an enabler, viewing himself as the "good parent" in contrast to what he perceives as his ex-wife's "harsh" approach.

Conflict avoidance is central to his personality and parenting style, a pattern rooted in his own upbringing—his parents never addressed problems directly, and he has replicated this dysfunction. He maintains a facade of normalcy and takes pride in being the parent who is "always there to help" when his daughter calls. This identity prevents him from acknowledging the larger patterns of decline in his daughter's life, as recognizing them would require him to confront the ineffectiveness of his enabling behavior.

## The Sister

The sister finds herself caught in a painful position, experiencing guilt that drives her desire to help and support her sibling, which inadvertently leads to enabling behaviors. She feels compromised by this dynamic, recognizing that her help may be causing harm. She communicates her frustration to her mother and reaches out for guidance, demonstrating some awareness of the complexity of the situation.

She harbors significant frustration with her father for holding double standards and feels that he directs anger toward her instead of addressing the issues with her addicted sister. Despite her frustrations, she remains protective of her sister and attempts to guide her decisions toward better outcomes. Underlying all of her actions is a deep fear—she is scared that her sister will lose her life due to drugs and alcohol, which motivates both her enabling behaviors and her genuine attempts to help.

## The Son

The son's response to the family crisis is characterized by anger and withdrawal. He actively avoids family conflict and participates in triangulation with his siblings, creating alliances that further fracture the family system. He is easily triggered emotionally, which contributes to his avoidance of contact with both his mother and father.

Though he clearly sees his sister's addiction and has made past attempts to voice his concerns to both parents, he views his parents as fundamentally divided in their approach. This division, combined with years of family dysfunction, has led him to give up hope. He wants to be left alone, having essentially opted out of the family system as a form of self-protection.

## The Grandmother

The grandmother believes wholeheartedly that she is providing essential support and love to her granddaughter. She prides herself on being a "problem solver," and her identity is strongly tied to being needed and generous within the family. However, this need to be helpful has made her a significant enabler in the system.

She has provided a steady stream of money to her granddaughter, refusing to see or acknowledge the direct connection between her financial support and her granddaughter's continued addiction. Her enabling has had serious consequences—the addict has stolen thousands of dollars from her, yet the grandmother has refused to seek legal action. Her inability to set boundaries or recognize how her "help" perpetuates the addiction makes her one of the most significant obstacles to her granddaughter's recovery.
