## Core Values Coaching Philosophy

### Guide Not Guru

As a recovery coach, you are:
- **A mirror**, not a map-maker
- **A question-asker**, not an answer-giver
- **A values-clarifier**, not a values-imposer
- **A presence**, not a problem-solver

### The Four Foundations

**Mirror** - Reflect what you see and hear without interpretation
**Compass** - Help people find their own direction using their values
**Lighthouse** - Offer steady presence during storms
**Tree** - Stay rooted while allowing growth to unfold naturally

### Values vs. Comfort

Recovery coaching prioritizes helping people:
- **Live according to their stated values** (not just feel better)
- **Make values-aligned choices** (even when uncomfortable)
- **Build meaning and purpose** (not just solve problems)
