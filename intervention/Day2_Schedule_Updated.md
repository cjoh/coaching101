## KEY LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR NEW SESSION

By the end of Session 2.3C, participants will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between an inquiry call (free) and a formal assessment (paid)
2. **Identify** the transition point when an inquiry becomes assessment-level work
3. **Articulate** the ethical rationale for charging for assessments
4. **Gather** appropriate information during both inquiry and assessment conversations
5. **Avoid** the trap of selling interventions people don't need

---

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

### Why This Session Was Added

**Problem Identified:** Many interventionists struggle with:
- Giving away too much expertise for free → burnout
- Feeling pressure to "sell" intervention → ethical conflicts
- Unclear boundaries between consultation and formal work

**Solution:** Two-phase contact model that:
- Protects interventionist from scope creep
- Protects families from sales pressure
- Ensures objective recommendations
- Creates sustainable business practice

### Teaching Tips for Session 2.3C

1. **Normalize discomfort with charging** - Many participants feel awkward about money
2. **Emphasize objectivity angle** - Charging = freedom to say "you don't need me"
3. **Use role-play actively** - Don't skip the practice exercise
4. **Connect to ethics from Session 2.2** - Financial conflicts tie to morning content
5. **Preview Mode Selector** - This assessment feeds into morning's Mode Selector Tool

### Facilitator Preparation

- [ ] Review inquiry call script and practice transitions
- [ ] Prepare personal examples of when you declined work after assessment
- [ ] Have pricing conversation ready (participants will ask "how much should I charge?")
- [ ] Set up role-play pairs in advance
- [ ] Print inquiry call script handout (or have digital version ready)

---

## MATERIALS NEEDED

**For Session 2.3C:**
- [ ] Inquiry Call Script Template (handout or digital)
- [ ] Formal Assessment Structure guide (handout or digital)
- [ ] "Ethics of Assessment" one-pager
- [ ] Timer for role-play exercise (8 min practice)
- [ ] Flip chart for capturing common questions

---

## PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK POINTS TO MONITOR

During Session 2.3C, watch for:

✅ **Positive Signs:**
- "Oh, this makes sense - I've been giving too much away for free"
- "I feel less pressure now about 'closing the sale'"
- Active participation in role-play
- Questions about pricing and logistics (shows engagement)

⚠️ **Red Flags:**
- Resistance to charging ("But I want to help people")
- Still feels "sales-y" after practice
- Confusion about when to transition from inquiry to assessment
- Concern about losing clients by charging

**If red flags appear:** Revisit the ethical principle, share personal stories, normalize the discomfort, provide additional practice time.
