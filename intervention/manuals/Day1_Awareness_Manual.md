# Day 1: Awareness - Building Self-Knowledge as an Interventionist

## Overview

Day 1 of the Core Values Interventionist Training begins your journey toward becoming an effective, values-aligned interventionist. This day focuses on building the foundation of self-awareness that makes ethical, impactful intervention work possible. You'll explore what makes intervention unique, examine your own recovery story and motivations, and begin understanding the crucial distinctions that keep both you and those you serve safe.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the unique role and responsibilities of an interventionist
- Develop clarity about your personal motivations and story
- Recognize the boundaries between intervention, therapy, coaching, and sponsorship
- Begin building a framework for ethical, values-based intervention practice

**Time Allocation:** 7 hours (including breaks)

## Session 1.1: Welcome & Foundations (60 minutes)

### Purpose

This opening session establishes psychological safety, builds connection among participants, and introduces the Core Values framework that will guide the entire training. The way you begin this journey sets the tone for three days of deep learning and personal growth.

### Opening Circle (20 minutes)

**What This Is:**
The Opening Circle creates a container for authentic learning. Unlike traditional introductions that focus on credentials or achievements, this circle invites you to show up as a whole person—with your hopes, hesitations, and humanity intact.

**How It Works:**
- Sit in a circle where everyone can see everyone else
- The facilitator begins with a brief land acknowledgment and intention-setting
- Each person shares their name, their pathway to this training, and one hope they hold for these three days
- No crosstalk, advice-giving, or commentary—just witnessing and receiving

**What You Might Notice:**
- Nervousness about speaking in front of strangers
- Relief at hearing others express similar hopes or concerns
- The power of being heard without interruption or judgment
- A shift in the room's energy as people begin to relax

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What did you notice in your body as you prepared to speak?
- What surprised you about what others shared?
- What does it mean to you to be witnessed without commentary?

### Training Overview (15 minutes)

**The Three-Day Arc:**

**Day 1 (Awareness)** lays the groundwork. You'll examine who you are, why you're here, and what intervention actually entails. This is about building self-knowledge before you can effectively serve others.

**Day 2 (Structure)** introduces the ARISE method and practical intervention tools. You'll learn evidence-based approaches while remaining grounded in values-driven practice.

**Day 3 (Practice)** brings everything together through simulation, role-play, and integration. You'll practice facilitating interventions in a safe environment before doing so in the real world.

**Why This Sequence Matters:**
You cannot guide others through transformation you haven't navigated yourself. This training follows the same principle we'll apply in intervention work: awareness before action, self-knowledge before service, values before techniques.

### Core Values Framework Introduction (25 minutes)

**The Foundation:**
The Core Values framework recognizes that lasting change happens when people align their actions with their deepest values. This isn't about imposing external rules or following prescribed steps—it's about helping people discover what matters most to them and building their lives around those truths.

**Four Core Values:**

**1. DIGNITY**
- What it means: Every person has inherent worth that cannot be diminished by their circumstances, choices, or struggles
- In practice: We treat everyone—including ourselves—with respect, regardless of where they are in their journey
- The challenge: Can you maintain dignity for someone whose behavior you find troubling?

**2. AUTONOMY**
- What it means: People have the right to make their own decisions, even ones we disagree with
- In practice: We offer information and support, but we don't control outcomes or manipulate decisions
- The challenge: Can you hold space for someone's choices while still expressing care and concern?

**3. AUTHENTICITY**
- What it means: Being genuinely ourselves rather than performing a role or hiding behind a professional mask
- In practice: We share our own struggles appropriately, acknowledge our limitations, and show up as real humans
- The challenge: Can you be professional without being artificial?

**4. RESPONSIBILITY**
- What it means: Owning our choices, their consequences, and our impact on others
- In practice: We model accountability, acknowledge mistakes, and maintain clear boundaries
- The challenge: Can you take responsibility for your role without taking responsibility for others' choices?

**How These Values Guide Intervention Work:**

In traditional intervention models, success is often measured by whether someone immediately accepts treatment. In values-based intervention, success is measured by whether we honored dignity, respected autonomy, showed up authentically, and took responsibility for our role—regardless of the immediate outcome.

This doesn't mean we're passive or that outcomes don't matter. It means we trust that when we create the right conditions—when we honor these four values—people are more likely to move toward change that lasts.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- Which of these four values feels most natural to you?
- Which one challenges you most?
- How have you experienced (or not experienced) these values in your own recovery journey?
- How might these values change the way you approach difficult conversations?

### Questions & Clarifications

**Common Questions:**

*"Isn't intervention about getting someone into treatment? How can we respect autonomy if that's the goal?"*

The goal isn't to force someone into treatment—it's to create conditions where they can make an informed choice about their own life. We respect autonomy by being honest about our concerns, sharing accurate information, and then stepping back to let them decide. Sometimes that means they say no. Our job is to make sure they have the chance to say yes.

*"What if someone's choices are putting others at risk?"*

Respecting autonomy doesn't mean ignoring harm. We can honor someone's agency while still setting boundaries about what we will and won't participate in. We can advocate for safety while acknowledging we can't control another person's behavior.

*"How do I stay authentic without making it all about my story?"*

Authenticity in intervention work means being genuinely present and human, not performing perfection. It means admitting when you don't know something, sharing relevant experiences when appropriate, and letting your care show. But it's always in service of the person you're supporting—not a therapy session for you.

## Session 1.2: What Is Intervention? (75 minutes)

### Purpose

This session defines intervention work and distinguishes it from other helping roles. Understanding what intervention is—and what it isn't—protects both you and the people you serve.

### Defining Intervention (20 minutes)

**The Basic Definition:**
An intervention is a structured conversation where people who care about someone communicate their concerns about that person's substance use or behavior, with the goal of motivating change.

**But That's Not the Whole Story:**

Traditional intervention models often focused on "breaking through denial" or leveraging consequences to force someone into treatment. Values-based intervention takes a different approach:

- **It's not about confrontation**—it's about connection
- **It's not about breaking someone down**—it's about building them up while being honest
- **It's not about control**—it's about creating conditions for choice
- **It's not about winning**—it's about caring enough to show up

**Key Elements:**

**1. Preparation:** Extensive work happens before the actual intervention meeting—assessing readiness, coordinating participants, researching treatment options, planning logistics.

**2. Structured Communication:** The intervention meeting follows a format that balances emotional expression with clear requests and next steps.

**3. Immediate Action:** If the person agrees to treatment, we're ready to act immediately—transportation arranged, admission confirmed, bags packed.

**4. Follow-Through:** The work doesn't end when someone enters treatment. Intervention includes supporting the family system through the transition and addressing what happens after the person leaves.

**What Makes Intervention Unique:**

- **Time-sensitivity:** Often working with people in crisis or at critical decision points
- **Family system involvement:** Not just supporting one person but navigating complex family dynamics
- **High stakes:** Decisions made in intervention can have life-or-death consequences
- **Resistance:** Unlike coaching where people seek help, intervention often involves people who haven't asked for our involvement
- **Logistics:** Coordinating treatment placement, insurance, transportation, timing

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What was your initial understanding of intervention before this training?
- How does values-based intervention differ from what you've seen portrayed in media?
- What aspects of intervention work feel exciting? What feels scary?

### Activity: Intervention vs. Other Roles (30 minutes)

**Purpose:**
This activity clarifies the boundaries between intervention and other helping roles. Understanding these distinctions protects you from scope creep and helps you know when to refer to other professionals.

**The Four Roles:**

**INTERVENTIONIST:**
- Focus: Facilitating structured conversations to motivate change, usually around substance use
- Timeframe: Short-term, crisis-oriented (days to weeks)
- Who initiates: Usually family/loved ones, not the person struggling
- Relationship: Professional, time-limited
- Training: Specialized in assessment, family systems, treatment placement, crisis management
- Example: "I'm going to help your family prepare for and facilitate a conversation about their concerns regarding your drinking"

**THERAPIST/COUNSELOR:**
- Focus: Treating mental health conditions, processing trauma, building coping skills
- Timeframe: Ongoing (months to years)
- Who initiates: The client themselves
- Relationship: Therapeutic alliance with clear clinical boundaries
- Training: Licensed mental health professional (LCSW, LPC, psychologist, psychiatrist)
- Example: "Let's explore the underlying factors contributing to your anxiety and develop strategies for managing it"

**RECOVERY COACH:**
- Focus: Supporting someone in building and maintaining recovery, developing life skills
- Timeframe: Medium to long-term (months to years)
- Who initiates: The person in recovery
- Relationship: Supportive, sometimes peer-based, more flexible than therapy
- Training: Peer recovery specialist certification or recovery coach training
- Example: "I'll walk alongside you as you build a life you don't want to escape from"

**SPONSOR:**
- Focus: Guiding someone through 12-step work within a mutual aid fellowship
- Relationship: Peer-based, spiritual companionship within recovery community
- Timeframe: Ongoing, as long as it serves both people
- Who initiates: The sponsee asks the sponsor
- Training: Lived experience in 12-step recovery, working the steps themselves
- Example: "Let's work through the fourth step together so you can experience the freedom it brings"

**Activity Instructions:**

You'll receive cards describing different scenarios. Working in small groups, identify:
1. Which role is most appropriate for each scenario
2. What red flags might indicate scope issues
3. When you might need to refer to another professional

**Scenarios for Discussion:**

*Scenario 1:* A family calls you because their 28-year-old son's drinking has escalated. He lost his job, his wife left, and he's now living in their basement. He denies there's a problem. They want help.
- **Primary role:** Interventionist
- **Why:** Family-initiated, person hasn't sought help, focused on substance use, crisis point
- **Potential referrals:** Therapist (for family members dealing with trauma), treatment center (for the son if he agrees)

*Scenario 2:* Someone who completed treatment three months ago calls you. They're struggling with anxiety about social situations and considering drinking again to cope. They want ongoing support building sober coping skills.
- **Primary role:** Recovery coach or therapist
- **Why:** Person-initiated, focused on ongoing recovery support and skill-building, not acute crisis
- **Not intervention because:** They're already in recovery and seeking help themselves

*Scenario 3:* A woman you worked with through intervention six months ago calls. She completed treatment and has been sober since. She wants help processing childhood trauma she's starting to remember now that she's not drinking.
- **Primary role:** Therapist
- **Why:** Requires clinical training in trauma treatment, beyond scope of intervention or coaching
- **Your role:** Support her in finding an appropriate trauma therapist, celebrate her courage in addressing this

*Scenario 4:* A man asks you to be his sponsor. You facilitated an intervention that got him into treatment, and he trusts you. You're both in 12-step recovery.
- **Primary role:** This is a boundary question
- **Why it's complicated:** The professional intervention relationship may make it difficult to transition to the peer-based sponsor relationship
- **Considerations:** Power dynamics, dual relationships, whether you can shift roles cleanly

**Debrief Questions:**
- What did you notice about the differences between these roles?
- Where do you see potential for boundary confusion?
- Have you ever experienced receiving help from someone in the wrong role? What was that like?
- What will you do when someone asks you for help that's outside your scope?

**The Boundary Principle:**

Clear boundaries aren't about being rigid or unhelpful—they're about ensuring people get the right kind of help from the right person. Saying "that's not my role, but let me help you find someone who can help with that" is one of the most caring things you can do.

### Group Discussion: Ethics & Boundaries (25 minutes)

**The Foundation:**

Ethics in intervention work isn't about following a rulebook—it's about holding yourself accountable to the values you claim to serve. When we prioritize dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility, ethical decisions become clearer (though not always easier).

**Key Ethical Principles:**

**1. Do No Harm**
- Consider the full impact of your involvement, not just the immediate goal
- Recognize that harm can come from action or inaction
- Question: "Could my involvement make things worse?"

**2. Informed Consent**
- Everyone participating in an intervention should understand what they're agreeing to
- People have the right to say no at any point
- Question: "Does this person understand what's happening and what I'm asking of them?"

**3. Confidentiality with Exceptions**
- What's shared with you is generally confidential
- Exceptions: Imminent danger to self or others, child abuse, elder abuse, court orders
- Question: "Have I clearly explained the limits of confidentiality?"

**4. Cultural Humility**
- Your approach may not fit everyone's cultural context
- Recovery looks different across cultures and communities
- Question: "Am I imposing my cultural assumptions on this family?"

**5. Self-Awareness**
- Know your triggers, limitations, and biases
- Recognize when your own story is interfering with your work
- Question: "Is this about them or about me?"

**Common Ethical Dilemmas:**

*Dilemma 1: The Desperate Family*

A family is willing to lie to get someone to the intervention meeting. "Just tell him we're going to brunch," they say. "Once he's there, he won't leave."

**The tension:** They're desperate and their loved one is in danger. But deception violates autonomy and authenticity.

**Questions to consider:**
- How might starting with deception affect the entire intervention?
- What message does it send about trust and honesty?
- Are there ways to increase the likelihood of attendance without lying?
- What if the person is in immediate danger?

**Possible approach:** "I understand your desperation, and I want to help. But I've learned that interventions built on deception often backfire. Let's talk about honest ways to invite him that respect his dignity while still expressing urgency."

*Dilemma 2: The Grateful Client*

After a successful intervention, the family wants to keep paying you for weekly "check-ins" that are starting to feel like ongoing therapy. You care about them and want to help, but this isn't what you're trained for.

**The tension:** They trust you and you've helped them. But scope creep puts everyone at risk.

**Questions to consider:**
- What harm could come from continuing beyond your scope?
- What's driving your desire to keep working with them?
- How can you support their ongoing needs without providing services you're not qualified for?

**Possible approach:** "I care about your family, and I want you to get the ongoing support you need. What you're describing sounds like family therapy, which is outside my role as an interventionist. Let me help you find a great therapist who can provide what you need."

*Dilemma 3: The Personal Connection*

You're asked to facilitate an intervention for someone who reminds you intensely of your own brother who died from an overdose. You find yourself feeling desperate to save this person.

**The tension:** Your personal experience gives you compassion and understanding. But it might also cloud your judgment.

**Questions to consider:**
- Can you maintain professional objectivity?
- Are you trying to get a different outcome with this person than you got with your brother?
- How will you manage your emotional responses?
- Is it fair to this person to work with them when you're carrying this history?

**Possible approach:** Consult with a supervisor or colleague. Be honest about the parallel. Consider referring to another interventionist if you can't separate your own grief from this person's situation.

**Discussion Prompts:**
- Which ethical principle feels most challenging to you?
- Have you witnessed ethical violations in recovery or helping settings? What was the impact?
- How will you know when you're outside your scope?
- What support systems do you need to help you navigate ethical dilemmas?

**The Practice of Ethics:**

Ethics isn't something you learn once and check off a list. It's an ongoing practice of:
- Pausing before acting
- Consulting with others when uncertain
- Prioritizing the person's wellbeing over your own ego or agenda
- Being willing to say "I don't know" or "I need help with this"
- Returning again and again to the core values that guide your work

## Session 1.3: Your Story & Motivations (90 minutes)

### Purpose

This session invites deep self-reflection about why you're drawn to intervention work and how your own story influences your practice. Self-awareness is the foundation of ethical, effective intervention work.

### Personal Story Exercise (40 minutes)

**Why This Matters:**

Your story is both your greatest asset and your greatest liability in this work. It gives you compassion, understanding, and credibility. It also creates blind spots, triggers, and the risk of making situations about you rather than the people you're serving.

The most effective interventionists know their story well enough to use it wisely and recognize when it's getting in the way.

**The Exercise:**

You'll have 30 minutes to write responses to these prompts. This is private—you won't be required to share anything you're not comfortable sharing, though you'll have opportunities to share if you choose.

**Prompts:**

**1. Your Recovery Journey:**
- What brought you into recovery? (This might be your own addiction, loving someone with addiction, growing up affected by addiction, or working in the field)
- What were the turning points?
- Who showed up for you? How?
- Who wasn't there when you needed them?
- What do you wish had been different?

**2. Your "Why":**
- Why do you want to do intervention work specifically?
- What do you hope to offer others that you received (or didn't receive)?
- What would it mean to you to help a family through an intervention?
- What needs of your own might this work fulfill?

**3. Your Vulnerabilities:**
- What aspects of intervention work might trigger your own pain?
- What types of people or situations might be especially challenging for you?
- What do you need to be aware of about yourself?
- What might cause you to lose objectivity?

**4. Your Strengths:**
- What wisdom have you gained from your experiences?
- What do you understand about struggle that someone without your history might not?
- What do you offer because of your journey, not in spite of it?

**Reflection Time:**

After writing, sit quietly with what came up. Notice:
- Which questions were easy to answer? Which were hard?
- What emotions arose as you wrote?
- What surprised you about your responses?
- What do you need to pay attention to as you move forward in this training?

### Partner Sharing (25 minutes)

**Purpose:**
Sharing your story with another person—even in brief form—helps you begin to distinguish between what's helpful to share in intervention work and what might be too much or inappropriately self-focused.

**How It Works:**

**Round 1 (10 minutes):** Partner A shares a 4-5 minute version of their story, focusing on:
- What brought them to this work
- One key insight from their own experience
- One concern they have about doing this work

Partner B listens without interruption, advice-giving, or sharing their own story. Just witness.

**Round 2 (10 minutes):** Switch roles. Partner B shares, Partner A listens.

**Debrief Together (5 minutes):**
- What was it like to share?
- What was it like to just listen?
- What did you notice about how you told your story?

**What to Notice:**

As you shared, were you:
- Speaking from a healed place or an open wound?
- Focused on connection or seeking validation?
- Offering hope or dwelling in pain?
- Clear about boundaries or blurring lines?

There's no judgment in these observations—they're just information about where you are and what you might need to address before doing this work professionally.

### Large Group Discussion (25 minutes)

**Sharing with the Group:**

Anyone who wants to can share one insight from their writing or partner conversation. Remember: You're not required to share details of your story. You can share the insight without the story behind it.

**Examples:**
- "I realized I want to do this work partly to get a different outcome than I got with my sister. That's something I need to watch."
- "I saw how much anger I still carry about how my family handled my addiction. I need to work through that before I can help other families."
- "I recognized that my experience gives me patience for people who aren't ready—because I wasn't ready for years."

**The Facilitator's Role:**

The facilitator will help the group notice patterns and themes:
- How personal experience can be both wisdom and blind spot
- The importance of ongoing personal work
- The distinction between sharing as connection vs. sharing as therapy
- The value of knowing your triggers before encountering them with clients

**Key Themes to Explore:**

**1. The "Savior Complex"**

Many people drawn to helping professions are motivated by a desire to rescue others—often from situations they couldn't fix in their own lives. This isn't inherently bad, but it becomes problematic when:
- You measure your worth by whether people change
- You work harder than the person you're helping
- You can't let people experience consequences of their choices
- You feel personally responsible for outcomes you can't control

**Question:** How will you distinguish between healthy helping and rescuing?

**2. Vicarious Healing**

Sometimes we enter helping fields hoping that helping others will heal us. Again, not inherently wrong—often true. But problematic when:
- You haven't done your own healing work first
- You use clients' stories to process your own trauma
- You need the work more than the people you're serving need you

**Question:** What healing do you need to do outside of your client work?

**3. The Authenticity Balance**

We talked about authenticity as a core value. But there's a difference between:
- Authentic presence (bringing your full, genuine self to the work)
- Self-disclosure (sharing details of your story)

You can be authentic without sharing your story. You can share your story without being authentic.

**Question:** How will you know when sharing your story serves the client vs. serves your need to be understood?

**4. Projection & Transference**

You will encounter people who remind you of:
- Yourself at your worst
- Your parent/child/sibling/friend who struggled
- The person you couldn't save
- The person who didn't save you

When you notice this happening, it's essential to:
- Name it (at least to yourself)
- Get supervision or consultation
- Consider whether you're the right person for this case
- Do your own therapy/healing work around it

**Question:** What will you do when you notice you're reacting to your own history more than the situation in front of you?

**The Practice of Self-Awareness:**

Self-awareness in this work means:

**Before you start:**
- Do your own recovery work
- Address your trauma
- Get therapy if needed
- Understand your motivations

**As you work:**
- Notice when you're triggered
- Recognize when you're working too hard
- Monitor your emotional responses
- Seek supervision regularly

**After challenging situations:**
- Debrief with colleagues
- Process your reactions
- Recommit to your own self-care
- Remember you can't pour from an empty cup

**Closing Reflection:**
- What do you need to address in your own healing before you're ready to do this work?
- Who in your life can help you stay self-aware?
- What will be your first sign that you're getting off track?

## Session 1.4: The ARISE Continuum (60 minutes)

### Purpose

This session introduces the ARISE Intervention model, an evidence-based approach that honors autonomy while creating powerful motivation for change. Understanding this continuum helps you meet families where they are and guide them through a structured process.

### ARISE Overview (20 minutes)

**What Is ARISE?**

ARISE stands for **A Relational Intervention Sequence for Engagement**. Developed by Dr. Judith Landau, it's an evidence-based model that:
- Engages 83% of identified patients in treatment (compared to 30% for traditional interventions)
- Reduces harm to both the person struggling and their family
- Works through progressive levels of involvement
- Starts with invitation rather than confrontation

**The Core Principle:**

ARISE recognizes that people are more likely to change when they're invited into a process rather than ambushed by one. It begins with the assumption that the person struggling probably wants help at some level—they just need the right conditions to access that desire.

**The Three Levels:**

**Level 1: First Call** (60-70% success rate)
- The person struggling is invited to the first planning meeting
- No confrontation, no surprise—just an invitation to participate in solving the problem
- Even if they don't come, the family learns how to change the system in ways that reduce enabling

**Level 2: Strength-Based Intervention** (15-20% additional success)
- If Level 1 doesn't work, the family continues meeting without the person
- They focus on their own changes and healing
- They prepare for a structured family meeting
- The person is invited (with full transparency) to a meeting where concerns will be shared

**Level 3: Traditional Intervention** (additional 5-10% success)
- If Levels 1 and 2 haven't worked, a more structured intervention is planned
- This looks more like traditional intervention but with all the groundwork laid
- Still values-based, still honoring dignity and autonomy as much as possible

**Why This Sequence Matters:**

Traditional intervention often starts at Level 3—the confrontational, high-stakes family meeting. ARISE recognizes that:
- Most people don't need that level of intensity
- Starting gently allows for less damage to relationships
- The process itself can create change even if treatment isn't immediately accepted
- Families heal through participation in the process

**The Paradigm Shift:**

Traditional model: "We need to break through their denial and force them to see reality."

ARISE model: "This person is struggling and the system around them is struggling too. Let's invite them into a collaborative process of healing for everyone."

**Reflection Prompts:**
- How does this approach differ from what you expected intervention to be?
- What feels more comfortable about starting with Level 1? What feels more challenging?
- How might this approach honor the core values of dignity and autonomy?

### Level 1: The First Call (15 minutes)

**What Happens:**

When a family first contacts you, you conduct a thorough assessment and then invite the person struggling to participate in the first meeting. This is revolutionary—in traditional models, the person struggling is kept in the dark until the intervention itself.

**The Invitation:**

The family says something like: "We've been worried about your drinking. We've contacted an interventionist to help us figure out how to support you. We'd like you to come to the first meeting so we can do this together as a family. Will you come?"

**Three Possible Responses:**

**1. "Yes, I'll come."** (This happens more often than you'd think)
- The person participates in planning their own treatment
- The family is empowered and united
- You facilitate a collaborative conversation
- Success rate: Very high when the person shows up

**2. "No, there's no problem."**
- The person declines but now knows the family is taking action
- The system begins to shift even without their participation
- You move to Level 2
- The person may change their mind after seeing the family's commitment

**3. "I'll think about it."**
- You keep the door open
- The family continues with their own work
- You may circle back to Level 1 before moving to Level 2

**What the Family Learns:**

Even when the person doesn't come to Level 1, the family begins learning:
- How to communicate clearly and calmly about their concerns
- How to stop enabling
- How to take care of themselves
- How to create natural consequences

This learning is valuable regardless of whether the person enters treatment immediately.

**Your Role:**

At Level 1, you're facilitating a collaborative family problem-solving process, not conducting an intervention in the traditional sense. You're:
- Creating safety for honest conversation
- Teaching communication skills
- Helping identify enabling patterns
- Developing a plan everyone can agree on

### Level 2: Strength-Based Intervention (15 minutes)

**When You Move to Level 2:**

If the person doesn't come to Level 1 meetings, or comes but isn't ready to accept help, you move to Level 2. This involves:
- Continued family meetings (usually 2-4 sessions)
- Family members working on their own healing
- Preparing for a more formal family meeting with the person
- Building motivation through changed family dynamics

**What's Different from Level 1:**

**Level 1** was collaborative—the person struggling was invited to help plan.

**Level 2** involves the family doing preparatory work without the person, but still with full transparency. The family might say: "We're continuing to meet with the interventionist. We're working on our own stuff and preparing to have a family meeting where we'll each share our concerns. We'd love for you to be part of this process."

**The Family's Work:**

During Level 2 meetings, families:
- Write impact letters (we'll cover this on Day 2)
- Identify enabling behaviors and make plans to stop them
- Work on their own recovery (Al-Anon, therapy, etc.)
- Build a united front while maintaining individual relationships
- Research treatment options
- Prepare for various outcomes

**The Strength-Based Focus:**

Even as families prepare to share concerns, Level 2 maintains a strength-based approach:
- Letters include expressions of love and hope
- The focus is on impact (how the person's behavior affects others) not judgment
- Natural consequences replace enabling
- The family offers help, not ultimatums

**When to Hold the Family Meeting:**

You'll hold the Level 2 family meeting when:
- The family is prepared (letters written, responses planned, treatment arranged)
- The person is experiencing natural consequences of their behavior
- The family has built enough strength to follow through
- You've maximized motivation without maximizing harm

### Level 3: Traditional Intervention (10 minutes)

**When You Move to Level 3:**

If Levels 1 and 2 haven't resulted in treatment engagement, Level 3 looks more like traditional intervention:
- More structured format
- Stronger boundaries and consequences
- More directive facilitation
- Greater emphasis on immediate treatment entry

**What's Still Different:**

Even at Level 3, values-based ARISE maintains:
- Dignity for the person struggling
- Respect for autonomy (they can still say no)
- Authenticity in communication
- Family responsibility for their own healing

**The Bottom Line Conversation:**

Level 3 might include clearer boundaries from family members:
- "If you don't get treatment, I can't continue to financially support you."
- "If you keep using, you can't live here anymore."
- "I love you, but I can't watch you die. I'm stepping back until you're ready for help."

These aren't manipulative ultimatums—they're healthy boundaries about what family members can and can't do.

**Important Reality:**

Even at Level 3, some people will say no. Values-based intervention acknowledges:
- We can't control anyone's choices
- Forcing someone into treatment rarely works long-term
- The family can heal even if the person doesn't enter treatment immediately
- Planting seeds matters even when we don't see immediate harvest

**The Continuum in Practice:**

Most families move through these levels over days or weeks, not months. The average ARISE process takes 4-7 days from first call to treatment entry. But the exact timing depends on:
- The person's readiness
- The family's capacity
- The severity of the situation
- Available treatment resources

## Session 1.5: Reflection & Integration (45 minutes)

### Purpose

This closing session allows you to process what you've learned, identify remaining questions, and prepare for Day 2. Integration time is essential—without it, information doesn't become wisdom.

### Personal Reflection (20 minutes)

**Quiet Reflection Time:**

Find a comfortable spot (you can stay in the room or find a quiet space nearby). Spend 20 minutes with these prompts:

**1. What stands out?**
- What from today's sessions surprised you?
- What confirmed something you already knew?
- What challenged your assumptions about intervention work?

**2. What's shifting?**
- How has your understanding of intervention changed today?
- What are you thinking about differently than you were this morning?
- What questions are emerging?

**3. What do you need?**
- What do you need to learn more about?
- What personal work is this bringing up for you?
- What support would help you engage more fully tomorrow?

**4. What are you carrying?**
- What emotions came up today?
- What old memories or experiences are present?
- What do you need to acknowledge or release before tomorrow?

**Journaling Prompts:**

If writing helps you process, consider these deeper prompts:

*On your story:*
"The part of my story that will most help me in this work is..."
"The part of my story I need to be most careful about is..."

*On the role:*
"What excites me most about intervention work is..."
"What scares me most about intervention work is..."

*On the training:*
"So far, this training is meeting my needs by..."
"I wish this training would also address..."

*On readiness:*
"I feel ready to..."
"I don't yet feel ready to..."
"To be ready, I need..."

### Small Group Processing (15 minutes)

**Purpose:**
Hearing how others are processing the material helps you integrate your own learning and builds community within the training group.

**Format:**

Groups of 3-4 people. Each person has 3-4 minutes to share one thing from their reflection time. Others listen without interrupting.

**Possible Sharing Prompts:**
- One insight that's sticking with you
- One question you're sitting with
- One way your thinking has shifted today
- One thing you're looking forward to (or nervous about) tomorrow

**Guidelines:**
- You don't have to share anything too personal
- No crosstalk or advice-giving
- If someone shares something vulnerable, a simple "thank you for sharing that" is enough
- Notice what you have in common with others

### Closing Circle (10 minutes)

**Returning to the Large Group:**

The facilitator invites everyone back to the circle. This is a brief check-out, not a full debrief.

**Popcorn Style Sharing:**

Anyone who wants to can offer:
- One word describing how you're feeling right now
- One phrase capturing your biggest takeaway
- One hope for tomorrow

**Examples:**
- "Grateful"
- "Overwhelmed but good overwhelmed"
- "I'm noticing my own enabling patterns"
- "Hopeful that there's a gentler way to do interventions"
- "Aware of how much personal work I still need to do"

**The Facilitator's Role:**

The facilitator will:
- Acknowledge the emotional weight of Day 1
- Normalize whatever people are feeling
- Preview Day 2 briefly
- Remind everyone of self-care
- Express confidence in the group's capacity

**Logistics & Homework:**

**For tonight:**
- Rest. This is deep work.
- If things came up that need attention, reach out to your support system
- Review the Day 1 schedule and your notes if it helps you integrate
- Don't worry about preparing anything—just come back tomorrow ready to learn

**Tomorrow (Day 2) preview:**
We'll shift from awareness to structure. You'll learn:
- The ARISE method in detail
- How to conduct first calls
- How to facilitate family meetings
- Impact letter writing
- Treatment planning and placement

**Closing Words:**

"Today was about building the foundation—understanding the role, understanding yourself, understanding the values that guide this work. Everything we do tomorrow and the next day will rest on what you learned today. Thank you for showing up, for being honest, for staying open even when it was uncomfortable. Rest well. See you tomorrow."

## Key Takeaways from Day 1

Before you leave today, make sure you understand these core concepts:

### About Intervention
- ✓ Intervention is a structured conversation designed to motivate change while honoring dignity and autonomy
- ✓ Values-based intervention prioritizes relationship and invitation over confrontation
- ✓ The ARISE model works through progressive levels (invitation → family work → structured meeting)
- ✓ Success isn't just about immediate treatment entry—it's about family healing and planting seeds

### About Your Role
- ✓ Interventionists are distinct from therapists, coaches, and sponsors
- ✓ Your scope is specific: facilitating change conversations, not providing ongoing therapy or coaching
- ✓ Clear boundaries protect both you and the people you serve
- ✓ Knowing when to refer is as important as knowing when to engage

### About Yourself
- ✓ Your story is both asset and liability—use it wisely
- ✓ Self-awareness is the foundation of ethical practice
- ✓ Your motivations matter and deserve examination
- ✓ Ongoing personal work isn't optional—it's essential

### About Values
- ✓ Dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility guide every decision
- ✓ These aren't just nice ideas—they're practical tools for navigating complexity
- ✓ When in doubt, return to these values
- ✓ You can honor someone's autonomy while still being honest about your concerns

## Looking Ahead: Day 2 Preview

**What's Coming:**

Day 2 takes the foundation you built today and gives you concrete tools and structures:

**Morning:** The ARISE method in detail—how to conduct first calls, assess family systems, and facilitate Level 1 meetings

**Mid-morning:** Impact letters—the heart of Level 2 interventions

**Afternoon:** Treatment planning, placement, and logistics

**Late afternoon:** Family meeting facilitation and managing different outcomes

**The Shift:**

Day 1 was about awareness and self-knowledge. Day 2 is about structure and skill-building. Day 3 will bring it all together through practice.

**What to Remember:**

No matter how many techniques you learn tomorrow, they only work if they rest on the foundation of values and self-awareness you built today. Keep returning to that foundation.

## Facilitator Notes

**Pacing Considerations:**
- Day 1 is emotionally heavy—build in adequate break time
- Watch for participants who seem triggered or overwhelmed
- Have resources available for anyone who needs additional support
- Consider offering optional debrief time after the official day ends

**Common Challenges:**
- Participants may resist the gentler ARISE approach if they're expecting traditional intervention training
- Personal stories can take over if not gently redirected
- Some participants may not be ready for this level of self-examination
- Boundary confusion is common—return to clear distinctions repeatedly

**Success Indicators:**
- Participants can articulate the four core values
- Participants can distinguish intervention from other helping roles
- Participants show awareness of their own triggers and motivations
- The group has developed psychological safety and trust

**Adaptations:**
- If the group is small (<8), you can do more large group processing and less small group work
- If the group is large (>20), add more small group time and structure sharing carefully
- For groups with varied experience levels, pair experienced and new people strategically
- For groups with significant trauma histories, move more slowly through personal story work
