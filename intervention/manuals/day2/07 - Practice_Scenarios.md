## Section 2.4: Practice Scenarios

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Core Value:** Practice builds competence and confidence

### Scenario 1: The Executive in Denial

**Background:**
Michael, 52, is a successful CEO. His wife called you after he got a DUI last week. He drinks daily, has high blood pressure, and his marriage is suffering. He has no prior treatment history and believes he "has it under control." The family is united in concern but hesitant to be too confrontational because they rely on his income.

**Your Task:**
- What mode would you use?
- Who would you involve?
- What leverage points exist?
- What treatment level is appropriate?

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do you handle the power dynamic of a high-status individual?
- What if he threatens to cut off financial support to the family if they "interfere"?
- How do you address his belief that he doesn't have a problem?

### Scenario 2: The Young Adult in Crisis

**Background:**
Emma, 23, overdosed two days ago and was revived with Narcan. She's currently in the ER. Her parents are divorced and don't agree on how to handle this. Mom wants immediate inpatient treatment. Dad thinks she needs to "hit bottom" and learn her lesson. Emma has been in outpatient therapy twice before and relapsed both times.

**Your Task:**
- What mode would you use?
- How do you handle the parental conflict?
- What's the most appropriate immediate action?
- How do you leverage the crisis without shaming Emma?

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do you work with parents who fundamentally disagree?
- What if Emma refuses treatment from the ER?
- How do you address dad's "hit bottom" belief?

### Scenario 3: The Isolated Individual

**Background:**
Jason, 38, is estranged from his family. His best friend called you because Jason's drinking has spiraled. He lives alone, lost his job three months ago, and rarely leaves his apartment. His family is toxic and abusiveâ€”involving them would be harmful. The friend is the only person Jason trusts.

**Your Task:**
- What mode would you use?
- How do you work without family involvement?
- What leverage points might exist?
- What if the friend isn't willing to set boundaries?

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do you assess whether family involvement would be helpful or harmful?
- What if Jason refuses help from his friend?
- How do you support the friend who is carrying this alone?

### Scenario 4: The Ambivalent Partner

**Background:**
Maria, 34, called you about her husband Carlos, who uses cocaine on weekends. He says it's "recreational" and "not a problem," but she's noticed escalation. He missed their daughter's birthday party last week because he was high. Carlos has agreed to meet with you one-on-one but refuses a "family intervention."

**Your Task:**
- What mode would you use?
- How do you engage someone who doesn't think they have a problem?
- What questions would you ask in the first meeting?
- What if he walks out of the meeting?

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do you balance engaging Carlos with respecting Maria's concerns?
- What if Maria wants you to be more confrontational than Carlos can handle?
- How do you assess whether "recreational use" is accurate or minimization?
