## Section 2.3C: The 5-Mode Intervention Continuum

**Duration:** 120 minutes (includes practice scenarios)
**Core Value:** Match your approach to the situation

### Understanding the Continuum

Not every situation requires a formal, surprise intervention. In fact, the most effective interventionists know how to match their approach to the individual's level of resistance, insight, and readiness. Think of intervention as a continuum, not a one-size-fits-all event.

**The Five Modes:**

1. **Collaborative Conversation** (Low resistance, some insight present)
2. **Structured Family Meeting** (Moderate resistance, willing to talk)
3. **Planned Formal Intervention** (High resistance, low insight, classic model)
4. **Crisis Intervention** (Immediate danger, unstable situation)
5. **Individual Strategic Approach** (Family unavailable, unsafe, or unable to participate)

Let's explore each mode in detail.

---

### MODE 1: Collaborative Conversation

**When to Use:**
- The individual has expressed some concern about their substance use
- There's openness to discussion, even if ambivalent
- Relationships are relatively intact
- No immediate safety crisis
- The person has some insight into how use is affecting their life

**Why This Works:**
When someone has a crack of awareness, you don't need a sledgehammer. A collaborative approach honors their autonomy while creating space for change.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation (1-2 hours)**

**A. Assess Readiness:**
- Use brief motivational interviewing questions to gauge openness
- Ask scaling questions: "On a scale of 1-10, how concerned are you about your substance use?"
- Listen for change talk: "I know I should cut back..." "This is affecting my relationships..."

**B. Identify the Right Messenger:**
- Who does the individual trust most?
- Who has the least conflict in the relationship?
- Often this is NOT a parent, but might be a sibling, friend, or respected mentor

**C. Choose the Right Setting:**
- Private and comfortable
- Free from distractions
- NOT when the person is intoxicated or in withdrawal
- Consider neutral territory (coffee shop, park) rather than someone's home

**Step 2: Opening the Conversation (10 minutes)**

**The Messenger's Approach:**

"[Name], I wanted to talk with you because I care about you and I've been worried. I'm not here to lecture or judge—I'm here to listen and understand what's going on."

**Opening Questions:**
- "How have you been feeling lately?"
- "I've noticed [specific observations]. Have you noticed that too?"
- "What's it like for you right now with [work/relationships/health]?"

**Step 3: Active Listening & Reflection (20 minutes)**

**Your Role as Facilitator:**
If you're coaching the family member through this, prepare them to:

**Listen for Change Talk:**
- "I know I need to make some changes..."
- "I'm tired of feeling this way..."
- "I can see how this is affecting my kids..."

**Reflect Back:**
- "It sounds like you're feeling torn between wanting to use and knowing it's causing problems."
- "On one hand you enjoy the relief substances give you, and on the other hand you hate the consequences."

**Avoid Common Traps:**
- Don't argue or tell them they're wrong
- Don't minimize their concerns to make them feel better
- Don't take over the conversation with advice

**Step 4: Collaborative Problem-Solving (20 minutes)**

**Introduce Options, Don't Demand:**

"It sounds like you're recognizing some concerns. I'm wondering if you'd be open to exploring some options?"

**Present Treatment as One Path:**
- "Some people find it helpful to talk with an addiction counselor..."
- "There are programs that can help you figure out what's going on..."
- "Would you be open to an assessment, just to get more information?"

**Scaling Questions:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is it to you to make a change?"
- "What would it take to move from a 4 to a 6?"

**Step 5: Action Planning (15 minutes)**

**If They're Open:**
- Schedule a specific next step (assessment appointment, doctor visit, first therapy session)
- Offer support: "I'll go with you if that would help."
- Create accountability: "Can we check in about this in a few days?"

**If They're Ambivalent:**
- Don't push too hard
- Plant seeds: "I hope you'll think about it. I'm here whenever you're ready."
- Keep the door open: "If things get worse or you want to talk more, I'm always available."

**If They Shut Down:**
- Don't escalate or argue
- End with care: "I care about you. That's why I brought this up."
- Prepare for next level of intervention if needed

---

### MODE 2: Structured Family Meeting

**When to Use:**
- The individual is resistant but willing to attend a "family meeting"
- The family is united in concern but not ready for full surprise intervention
- There's moderate denial or minimization
- The person has some relationships they still value
- You want to create a unified message without full confrontation

**Why This Works:**
This is the middle ground—more structured than a casual conversation, but less confrontational than a surprise intervention. It allows for prepared statements while maintaining some dignity and choice.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Pre-Meeting Preparation (2-4 hours)**

**A. Recruit Meeting Participants:**

Choose 3-6 family members or loved ones who:
- Have direct relationships with the individual
- Can speak from a place of care, not anger
- Will commit to the process and maintain confidentiality
- Represent different aspects of the person's life (parent, sibling, friend, colleague)

**B. Frame the Meeting Invitation:**

The individual needs to agree to attend. Common frames:
- "We'd like to have a family meeting to talk about some concerns."
- "There are some things we need to discuss as a family."
- "We'd like to check in together about how everyone is doing."

**Be honest but not revealing:**
- Don't lie about the purpose
- Don't reveal the full scope of preparation
- Don't mention the word "intervention" if it will trigger resistance

**C. Prepare Individual Statements:**

Each participant writes a short statement (2-3 minutes spoken) that includes:

**1. Opening with Care:**
"[Name], I love you and I'm here because I care about you."

**2. Specific Observations:**
"I've noticed that [specific behavior] and I'm worried because [specific impact]."

**Example:**
"I've noticed that you've missed three family dinners in the past month, and when you do come, you seem distant and irritable. I'm worried because our relationship used to be so close and now it feels like you're slipping away."

**3. Personal Impact:**
"When this happens, I feel [emotion] because [reason]."

**Example:**
"When you don't show up, I feel scared that I'm losing you. I also feel angry because it affects everyone, especially the kids who ask where you are."

**4. Request:**
"I'm asking you to consider getting help. We've found a program that can assess what's going on and help you figure out next steps."

**D. Prepare Treatment Options:**

Have 2-3 pre-screened treatment options ready:
- Confirmed bed availability
- Clear admission process
- Insurance or payment verified
- Transportation arranged

**Step 2: Day-of-Meeting Setup (30 minutes before)**

**A. Arrange the Room:**
- Circle or semi-circle seating
- Individual sits with facilitator, not cornered
- Tissues available
- Remove distractions (turn off TV, put away phones)
- Have treatment information printed and ready

**B. Pre-Meeting Family Huddle:**

Brief review with family:
- "Remember, we speak from love, not anger."
- "Share your statement, then stop. Don't argue or debate."
- "If they get defensive, I'll redirect. Trust the process."
- "Our goal is to offer help, not punish."

**Step 3: Opening the Meeting (5 minutes)**

**Your Role as Facilitator:**

"[Name], thank you for being here. I know this might feel uncomfortable, and I appreciate your willingness to listen. Everyone here loves you and is concerned. We're going to take turns sharing, and then we'll talk about next steps. I'm here to help guide the conversation so it stays productive. Does that sound okay?"

**If they resist immediately:**
"I hear that you're feeling defensive. That's understandable. I'm asking you to give us 30 minutes to share what's on our hearts. After that, you can respond however you want. Can you do that?"

**Step 4: Family Statements (15-30 minutes)**

**Go around the circle. Each person reads their prepared statement.**

**Your role:**
- Keep time (2-3 minutes per person)
- Redirect if someone goes off-script into blaming or arguing
- Pause between speakers for the individual to breathe and absorb
- Hold space for emotion without rushing

**If the individual interrupts or argues:**
"I know it's hard to hear this. We'll have time for you to respond. Right now, I'm asking you to just listen."

**Step 5: Presenting Treatment Options (10 minutes)**

**After all statements, transition to solutions:**

"[Name], everyone here has shared because they love you and they're worried. We're not here to punish you or control you. We're here to offer help."

**Present options clearly:**
- "We've researched programs that specialize in [substance use/dual diagnosis/trauma]."
- "Here are three options. Let's review each one together."
- "All of them have availability this week. We can help with logistics, insurance, and transportation."

**Offer choice within structure:**
"Which of these feels like the right fit for you?"

**Step 6: Decision Point (5-15 minutes)**

**If they agree:**
- Confirm which program they choose
- Lock in admission details immediately
- Don't delay—momentum matters
- Celebrate the courage it takes to say yes
- "This is the hardest and bravest step. We're so proud of you."

**If they're ambivalent:**
- Use motivational interviewing: "What makes you hesitate?"
- Reflect their concerns: "It sounds like you're worried about work/family/cost. Let's talk about how to address that."
- Offer a smaller step: "What if you agreed to an assessment this week, and then we can talk about next steps?"

**If they refuse:**
- Stay calm and compassionate
- "We hear you. We can't force you. But we need you to know that things can't continue as they are."
- **Share boundary changes** (see Step 7)

**Step 7: Boundary Statements (If Needed) (10 minutes)**

If the individual refuses treatment, family members share what will change:

**Format:**
"Because I love you and I can't watch you hurt yourself anymore, I will no longer [enabling behavior]. I hope you choose treatment, but either way, this boundary is firm."

**Examples:**
- "I will no longer give you money."
- "I will no longer lie to your employer about why you miss work."
- "You can't live here unless you're in treatment."

**Important:**
- Boundaries are not punishments—they're self-care
- They must be realistic and enforceable
- They should be presented with love, not anger

**Step 8: Follow-Up (Immediately After & Ongoing)**

**If they agreed to treatment:**
- Execute transportation immediately if possible (same day or next day)
- Assign a point person for treatment communication
- Debrief with family about self-care during treatment
- Schedule family program participation if available

**If they refused:**
- Debrief with family about next steps
- Reinforce boundaries and support systems
- Discuss timeline for re-approach
- Consider moving to Mode 3 (Formal Intervention) or Mode 5 (Individual Approach)

---

### MODE 3: Planned Formal Intervention

**When to Use:**
- The individual has high resistance and low insight
- Prior conversations have failed
- The family is committed to a structured approach
- There are significant consequences or safety concerns
- The individual is unlikely to attend a voluntary "family meeting"
- This is the classic "surprise intervention" model

**Why This Works:**
When someone is deeply entrenched in denial, a planned intervention breaks through the defenses by creating an undeniable moment of truth. It's not about ambush—it's about creating a container strong enough to hold the reality they've been avoiding.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Team Assembly & Pre-Work (1-2 weeks before)**

**A. Select Intervention Team Members:**

Choose 4-8 people who:
- Have a meaningful relationship with the individual
- Can speak from care, not anger or control
- Will commit to the full preparation process
- Can maintain confidentiality before the intervention
- Represent different life domains (family, work, friends)

**Who NOT to include:**
- Anyone currently using substances with the individual
- Anyone with an active serious conflict with the person
- Anyone who can't regulate their emotions during difficult conversations
- Anyone who the individual deeply mistrusts

**B. Initial Team Meeting:**

**Purpose:** Align on goals, process, and roles

**Agenda:**
1. Introductions and relationship context
2. Share observations and concerns (evidence gathering)
3. Education about intervention process
4. Role assignments
5. Timeline and logistics
6. Homework: Writing statements

**C. Individual Statement Writing:**

Each team member prepares a statement with this structure:

**Part 1: Opening with Love (1 sentence)**
"[Name], I'm here today because I love you deeply."

**Part 2: Specific Observations (2-3 examples)**
Use concrete, undeniable facts:
- "Last Tuesday, I found you passed out on the bathroom floor."
- "You've missed 10 days of work in the past month."
- "You drove the kids home from school while intoxicated."

**Avoid:**
- Generalizations: "You're always drunk."
- Judgments: "You're a terrible parent."
- Exaggerations: "You never care about anyone."

**Part 3: Personal Impact (1-2 sentences)**
"When this happened, I felt [specific emotion] because [specific impact]."

**Example:**
"When I found you passed out, I felt terrified that you were going to die. I also felt helpless because I don't know how to help you anymore."

**Part 4: The Ask (1-2 sentences)**
"I'm asking you to accept treatment today. We've arranged for a bed at [program name], and we're ready to take you there now."

**Total length: 2-3 minutes spoken**

**D. Statement Refinement:**

Review each statement individually:
- Remove blame language
- Strengthen specific evidence
- Ensure emotional authenticity
- Practice tone and delivery
- Anticipate reactions

**E. Rehearsal Session:**

**Purpose:** Build confidence and coordination

**Process:**
1. Arrange the room as it will be on intervention day
2. Each person reads their statement aloud
3. Facilitator role-plays potential reactions
4. Practice responses to deflection, anger, or denial
5. Refine order of speakers (usually start with least threatening person)
6. Practice transitions between speakers
7. Address any lingering doubts or fears

**Step 2: Logistics & Treatment Coordination (1 week before)**

**A. Secure Treatment Placement:**
- Confirm bed hold with specific facility
- Verify admission requirements (insurance, medical clearance, deposits)
- Understand their detox protocols and medical capabilities
- Get clear directions and admission contact

**B. Prepare Transportation:**
- Professional transport service (if high risk of resistance)
- Family member (if cooperation likely)
- Backup plan if they refuse to get in the car

**C. Pack Their Belongings:**
Have a bag ready with:
- Clothing for 30-90 days (depending on program length)
- Toiletries (check facility's approved items list)
- Medications (in original bottles)
- ID, insurance card, phone charger
- Comfort items (photos, journal)

**D. Arrange Time Off:**
If employed:
- FMLA paperwork if applicable
- Communication plan with employer
- Medical leave documentation

**E. Plan the Invitation:**

How will you get them to the intervention location?

**Common strategies:**
- "Can we meet for lunch to talk about something important?"
- "Mom wants to have a family meeting at her house Sunday morning."
- "I need your help with something—can you come over Saturday?"

**Important:**
- Be honest but not revealing
- Don't lie outright (damages trust irreparably)
- Have a backup plan if they refuse to come

**Step 3: Day-of Intervention Setup (1 hour before)**

**A. Room Arrangement:**
- Chairs in circle or semi-circle
- Individual's seat NOT facing a wall or cornered
- Exits accessible but not blocked
- Remove sharp objects or alcohol
- Have tissues and water available
- Treatment information packet ready

**B. Team Arrival & Final Prep:**
- Team arrives 45 minutes early
- Individual arrives at scheduled time (doesn't see cars or preparation)
- Final pep talk: "Remember, we're doing this from love. Trust the process."

**C. Facilitator Preparation:**

**Your role:**
- Open the intervention with context
- Guide the flow of statements
- Manage emotional escalation
- Present treatment options
- Hold the boundary if they refuse

**Step 4: The Intervention Opening (5 minutes)**

**The individual arrives. They see the assembled team.**

**Your opening:**

"[Name], thank you for being here. I know this might feel like a surprise, and you might be wondering what's going on. Everyone in this room loves you deeply, and they're here today to talk about something very important. They each have something they want to share with you, and I'm here to help guide the conversation."

**If they try to leave:**
"I know this is uncomfortable. I'm asking you to give us 30 minutes. You can leave after that if you want, but we're asking you to hear what your family has to say first."

**If they're angry:**
"I understand you feel blindsided. That's fair. The reason we're doing it this way is because every other attempt to talk about this hasn't worked. We're hoping that by coming together like this, you'll hear how much everyone cares and how serious this has become."

**Set expectations:**
"Here's how this will work: Each person will share for a few minutes. I'll ask you to listen without interrupting. At the end, you'll have a chance to respond and we'll talk about next steps. Does that make sense?"

**Step 5: Family Statements (20-40 minutes)**

**Go around the circle. Each person reads their statement.**

**Your facilitation role:**

**Between speakers:**
- "Take a breath. I know that was hard to hear."
- "Let's hear from [next person]."

**If they interrupt with denial:**
- "I hear you want to respond. We'll get to that. Right now, please listen."

**If they interrupt with anger:**
- "I know you're upset. These people love you. Please give them a chance to finish."

**If they shut down (crying, head down, silent):**
- Allow the emotion. Don't rush.
- "It's okay to feel what you're feeling."
- After a moment: "Let's continue."

**If they try to leave:**
- "I know this is hard. You've heard from [number] people. There are [number] left. Can you stay for just a bit longer?"
- If they insist on leaving: "We can't force you to stay. But please know that everyone here loves you and we're asking you to accept help today."

**Step 6: Presenting Treatment (10 minutes)**

**After all statements:**

"[Name], you've just heard from people who love you. They're not here to punish you or attack you. They're here because they're scared and they want to help."

**Present the treatment option:**

"We've arranged for a bed at [program name]. It's a 30-day inpatient program that specializes in [addiction type]. They have availability today. We have a bag packed for you. We can take you there right now."

**Offer concrete details:**
- "The program includes medical detox, therapy, group support, and aftercare planning."
- "Your insurance covers it" OR "We've arranged payment."
- "You'll have contact with family through phone calls and family program."

**Choice within structure:**
"We're asking you to go today. Are you willing?"

**Step 7: Decision Point (10-30 minutes)**

**Response 1: They agree immediately**
- Celebrate: "This is the hardest and bravest step you could take. We're so proud of you."
- Lock in logistics: "Let's get your bag and head to the car."
- Assign a driver and support person
- Depart as soon as possible (momentum is everything)

**Response 2: They're ambivalent or negotiating**

**Common deflections and responses:**

**"I don't need inpatient. I can do outpatient."**
Response: "We've tried less intensive approaches. We need the structure and safety of inpatient right now. Outpatient can come later as a step-down."

**"I need to go to work first / handle some things."**
Response: "We've taken care of work. Your health is more important than anything else right now. Everything else can wait."

**"I'll go next week."**
Response: "We have a bed today. Next week isn't guaranteed. We need to act now while we have this opportunity."

**"I just need to taper down first."**
Response: "The treatment program has medical staff who will help you detox safely. You don't have to do this alone."

**Use motivational interviewing:**
- "What's making you hesitate?"
- Reflect back: "It sounds like you're worried about [concern]. Here's how we can address that..."
- Scaling questions: "On a scale of 1-10, how willing are you to accept help right now? What would move you from a 4 to a 6?"

**Response 3: They refuse outright**

**Stay calm and compassionate:**
"We hear you. We can't force you. But we need you to know that things cannot continue as they are."

**Boundary statements:**

Each family member shares a prepared boundary:

**Format:**
"Because I love you and I can't enable this anymore, [specific consequence will happen]. I hope you choose treatment, but this boundary stands either way."

**Examples:**
- "You can no longer live in this house unless you're in treatment."
- "I will no longer give you money or pay your bills."
- "I will not cover for you at work or lie about where you are."
- "If you drive intoxicated again, I will call the police."

**Important:**
- These must be enforceable and realistic
- Family members must follow through
- Boundaries are stated calmly, not as threats
- They're about self-care, not punishment

**Final statement:**
"The treatment bed is available for 24 hours. If you change your mind, call me. After that, we'll need to reassess. We love you. We hope you choose life."

**Step 8: Follow-Up**

**If they agreed to treatment:**

**Immediate (Day 0-1):**
- Transport to facility
- Complete admission process
- Communicate with admissions team about intervention context
- Debrief with family about self-care

**First week:**
- Give them space to adjust (most programs recommend no contact for 3-7 days)
- Coordinate family program participation
- Establish communication protocol with treatment team

**Ongoing:**
- Family therapy sessions as offered by program
- Discharge planning involvement
- Aftercare coordination

**If they refused treatment:**

**Immediate (Day 0-1):**
- Debrief with intervention team
- Process emotions (grief, anger, fear, guilt)
- Reinforce boundary commitments
- Remove self-blame: "You did everything you could."

**First week:**
- Follow through on stated boundaries immediately
- Maintain family support for each other
- Consider Al-Anon or family therapy
- Monitor for signs of readiness to re-approach

**Ongoing:**
- Stay aware of crisis points or consequences that might create new openness
- Maintain boundaries consistently
- Be ready to act if they reach out for help
- Consider Mode 4 (Crisis Intervention) or Mode 5 (Individual Approach) if circumstances change

---

### MODE 4: Crisis Intervention

**When to Use:**
- Immediate safety risk (suicidal ideation, overdose, severe medical crisis)
- Legal emergency (arrest imminent, court mandate)
- Acute psychiatric episode (psychosis, severe depression)
- Situation is too unstable to wait for planned intervention
- The individual is a danger to self or others

**Why This Works:**
Crisis creates urgency and removes the luxury of denial. In crisis mode, immediate action supersedes perfect planning. Your role is to stabilize, connect to emergency resources, and transition to appropriate care.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Safety Assessment (Immediate)**

**Ask direct questions:**
- "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
- "Do you have a plan?"
- "Do you have access to weapons or means?"
- "Have you used substances in the past 24 hours? What and how much?"

**Medical crisis signs:**
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Seizures
- Unconsciousness
- Severe confusion or disorientation
- Withdrawal symptoms (tremors, hallucinations)

**If life-threatening:**
**CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. Do not attempt to handle medical emergencies alone.**

**Step 2: Emergency Resources**

**Connect to appropriate crisis services:**

**Suicidal ideation:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text 988)
- Stay with them until help arrives
- Remove access to means (medications, weapons, alcohol)

**Overdose:**
- **Call 911**
- Administer Narcan if available and trained
- Provide rescue breathing if not breathing
- Stay until EMS arrives

**Psychiatric crisis:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** or local mobile crisis team
- Communicate symptoms clearly
- Request psychiatric evaluation
- Consider emergency detention if they're a danger to self/others

**Medical detox needed:**
- **Call addiction crisis line** or treatment facility
- Don't attempt home detox for alcohol or benzodiazepines (can be fatal)
- Transport to ER if severe withdrawal symptoms present

**Step 3: Crisis Intervention Facilitation**

**If the situation is stabilized enough to talk:**

**Your role is to:**
1. Provide immediate emotional support
2. Assess willingness to accept help now
3. Leverage the crisis as a motivator for treatment
4. Act quickly while the window is open

**Opening:**
"I'm here with you. You're not alone. Right now, we need to make sure you're safe. After that, we can talk about next steps."

**Once stabilized:**
"This crisis is telling you something. Things can't continue like this. Will you let me help you get into treatment right now?"

**Step 4: Rapid Treatment Placement**

**Crisis creates urgency—use it:**

**Call treatment facilities directly:**
- "I have a client in crisis who needs immediate placement."
- "This is an emergency. What's your fastest admission process?"
- Be prepared to transport immediately

**Options:**
- **Hospital psychiatric unit** (if psychiatric crisis)
- **Medical detox facility** (if withdrawal risk)
- **Crisis stabilization unit** (short-term stabilization before residential)
- **Residential treatment** (if medically stable and willing)

**Bypass typical intake processes when possible:**
- Explain the urgency
- Request expedited admission
- Offer to transport immediately
- Provide medical information quickly

**Step 5: Family Communication**

**Notify family of crisis:**
- Be factual and calm
- Explain current status and plan
- Request their support for immediate action
- Address their fears and questions

**If family isn't immediately available:**
- Proceed with crisis stabilization
- Loop them in as soon as appropriate
- Document your decision-making process

**Step 6: Transportation & Transition**

**Crisis transport options:**

**Professional transport services:**
- Use for high resistance or safety concerns
- Trained in de-escalation and safe restraint
- Faster and less emotionally charged than family transport

**Family transport:**
- Appropriate if person is cooperative
- Have two people in car (driver + support)
- Remove opportunity to change mind (direct route, no stops)

**Emergency services (EMS/police):**
- Use if danger to self or others
- Request CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) officers if available
- Communicate mental health crisis, not criminal behavior

**Step 7: Post-Crisis Follow-Up**

**Immediate (First 48 hours):**
- Confirm successful admission
- Brief treatment team on crisis context
- Provide family with updates
- Document crisis intervention process

**First week:**
- Monitor stabilization
- Coordinate family involvement
- Begin transition planning for appropriate level of care
- Debrief with family about trauma response and self-care

**Ongoing:**
- Follow typical treatment coordination process
- Address family trauma from crisis
- Plan for ongoing safety and relapse prevention

---

### MODE 5: Individual Strategic Approach

**When to Use:**
- Family is unable or unwilling to participate
- Family involvement would be counterproductive or dangerous
- The individual is estranged from family
- Prior family interventions have failed and individual refuses family contact
- The individual has explicitly requested that family not be involved
- One-on-one relationship is stronger and more influential than family system

**Why This Works:**
Sometimes the most powerful relationship isn't within the family. A trusted friend, mentor, employer, or coach can have more influence than a family gathering. This mode honors that reality and uses strategic one-on-one conversations instead of group interventions.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Identify the Key Relationship**

**Who has the most influence?**

Consider:
- **Employer or supervisor** (especially if job is at risk)
- **Best friend or close confidant** (peer influence can be powerful)
- **Mentor or sponsor** (from prior recovery, spiritual community, or professional life)
- **Romantic partner** (if relationship is healthy and not co-dependent)
- **Physician or therapist** (if trust exists)
- **You, the interventionist** (if you've built sufficient rapport)

**Assess influence factors:**
- Trust level (do they believe this person has their best interest at heart?)
- Respect (do they value this person's opinion?)
- Leverage (does this person control resources or consequences that matter?)
- Timing (is this person available now?)

**Step 2: Strategic Planning Session**

**Meet with the influential person to plan:**

**A. Understand Their Relationship:**
- "Tell me about your relationship with [name]."
- "How have they responded when you've expressed concern in the past?"
- "What do you think they respect most about you?"
- "What do you think would motivate them to listen to you?"

**B. Identify Leverage Points:**

**Leverage isn't manipulation—it's honest acknowledgment of consequences:**

**Common leverage points:**
- **Employment:** "If your performance doesn't improve, we'll have to let you go."
- **Legal:** "The judge gave you a choice: treatment or jail."
- **Relationships:** "I can't continue in this relationship if things don't change."
- **Health:** "Your doctor says your liver is failing. This is life or death."
- **Financial:** "I can't keep supporting you financially if you won't get help."

**C. Prepare the Conversation:**

**Write a structured script:**

**Part 1: Opening**
"I need to talk with you about something important. I care about you, and I'm worried."

**Part 2: Specific Observations**
"I've noticed [specific behaviors]. These aren't judgments—they're facts I can see."

**Part 3: Consequences**
"Here's what's happening as a result: [job performance, health, relationship strain, legal issues]."

**Part 4: The Ask**
"I'm asking you to accept help. I've researched treatment options, and I'm willing to help you get there."

**Part 5: Boundary/Leverage**
"If you're not willing to get help, here's what will change: [specific consequence]."

**Step 3: Pre-Conversation Treatment Coordination**

**Even without family, prepare treatment options:**

**A. Secure placement:**
- Confirm bed availability
- Verify insurance or payment
- Understand admission requirements

**B. Arrange logistics:**
- Transportation plan
- Time off work (if applicable)
- Personal belongings packed and ready

**C. Have backup options:**
- Outpatient intensive programs
- Sober living arrangements
- Individual therapy as first step

**Step 4: The One-on-One Conversation**

**Setting:**
- Private location
- Free from distractions
- NOT when they're intoxicated
- Enough time for full conversation (30-60 minutes)

**Your role (if you're coaching the influential person):**
- Prepare them emotionally
- Rehearse the script
- Plan for potential reactions
- Offer to be present (in person or on phone) for support

**The Conversation Flow:**

**Opening (2 minutes):**
"Thanks for meeting with me. I know you might sense this is serious, and it is. I care about you too much to stay silent anymore."

**Observations (5 minutes):**
"Here's what I've observed..." [Share specific, factual examples]

**Impact (5 minutes):**
"Here's how this is affecting you and others..." [Health, relationships, work, legal]

**Treatment Offer (5 minutes):**
"I've found a program that can help. They have a bed available this week. I'll help you with logistics, insurance, and transportation. Will you go?"

**Decision Point (10-20 minutes):**

**If they agree:**
- Lock in details immediately
- Don't delay ("Let me think about it" often becomes "never")
- Celebrate their courage
- Execute transportation as soon as possible

**If they're ambivalent:**
- "What's making you hesitate?"
- "What would need to be different for you to say yes?"
- "What if we start with an assessment, just to see what's recommended?"

**If they refuse:**
- Share the boundary/consequence calmly
- "I hear you. I can't force you. But I need you to know that [specific consequence] will happen."
- "I hope you change your mind. If you do, I'm here to help."
- Follow through on the stated boundary

**Step 5: Follow-Up**

**If they agreed to treatment:**

**Immediate:**
- Transport to facility as soon as possible
- Communicate with treatment team
- Coordinate ongoing support

**Ongoing:**
- Maintain appropriate contact during treatment
- Participate in family program if invited
- Plan discharge support

**If they refused:**

**Immediate:**
- Process emotions (disappointment, fear, frustration)
- Follow through on boundary immediately
- Consider whether family involvement should now be revisited

**Ongoing:**
- Monitor for crisis points or consequences that create new opportunities
- Maintain the boundary consistently
- Stay available if they change their mind
- Consider whether a different influential person should try
