## Section 2.2: Multidisciplinary Coordination

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Core Value:** Collaboration creates comprehensive care

### The Intervention Team Ecosystem

Effective interventions rarely happen in isolation. You'll coordinate with:

- **Treatment Providers** (admissions, clinical staff, medical teams)
- **Family Members** (with varying levels of involvement and agreement)
- **Legal Professionals** (attorneys, probation officers, judges)
- **Healthcare Providers** (primary care, psychiatrists, specialists)
- **Employers/HR** (when work is involved in the intervention)
- **Spiritual Leaders** (when appropriate to the family's values)
- **Other Interventionists** (co-facilitation or consultation)

### 2.2A: Pre-Intervention Team Building

**Step 1: Identify Key Players**

Create a comprehensive stakeholder map:

| Role | Name | Relationship to Individual | Level of Influence | Concerns/Priorities |
|------|------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Parent | Mom (Sarah) | Mother | High | Safety, health |
| Employer | Boss (David) | Manager | Medium | Job performance, liability |
| Treatment | Admissions (Lisa) | Intake coordinator | High | Appropriate placement |

**Step 2: Individual Pre-Meetings**

Meet with each team member separately to:
- Understand their perspective and concerns
- Assess their emotional state and readiness
- Clarify their role in the intervention
- Address any conflicts or misalignments
- Prepare their communication for the meeting

**Pre-Meeting Framework:**

**Opening:** "Thank you for taking time to meet with me. I know you care deeply about [name], and I want to make sure we're all aligned in supporting them."

**Assessment Questions:**
- "What are your biggest concerns right now?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "What do you hope happens as a result of this intervention?"
- "What are you worried might go wrong?"

**Role Clarification:**
- "During the intervention, I'll be facilitating the conversation. Your role is to..."
- "You'll share your concerns and offer support. Here's how we'll structure that..."

**Conflict Resolution:**
If family members disagree on approach:
- Acknowledge the different perspectives
- Find common ground (usually safety and wellbeing)
- Establish ground rules for the intervention itself
- Consider whether all parties should be present, or if some should participate differently

### 2.2B: Treatment Provider Coordination

**Before the Intervention:**

**Verify Bed Availability:**
- Confirm the exact admission date and time
- Understand cancellation/hold policies
- Get clear transportation instructions

**Clarify Clinical Requirements:**
- Medical clearance needed?
- Detox protocols and medications
- What to bring/not bring
- Insurance pre-authorization status

**Establish Communication Protocol:**
- Who at the facility will be the family contact?
- How will updates be shared during treatment?
- What's the family involvement structure?

**During the Intervention:**

Have the admissions coordinator available by phone:
- Can answer questions about the program
- Provides reassurance about the process
- Confirms logistical details
- Offers immediate next steps if the individual agrees

**After the Intervention:**

**If the individual agrees to treatment:**
- Confirm admission timeline
- Share relevant clinical information (with proper releases)
- Facilitate smooth transportation
- Brief the treatment team on intervention context

**If the individual declines:**
- Update the treatment team on the outcome
- Discuss whether bed hold is appropriate
- Plan for potential re-approach timing
- Maintain relationship for future opportunities

### 2.2C: Managing Complex Team Dynamics

**Challenge: Family Members in Conflict**

**Example:** Mom and Dad are divorced and disagree about the intervention approach.

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Meet with each parent separately first
2. Identify shared concerns and goals
3. Name the differences without judgment
4. Focus on what serves the individual, not who is "right"
5. Consider co-facilitating with separate pre-meetings
6. Establish ground rules about respectful communication

**Challenge: Enabling Family Member**

**Example:** Grandmother keeps giving money and undermining boundaries.

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Compassionate exploration: "Help me understand what makes it hard to hold this boundary?"
2. Education about enabling vs. supporting
3. Offer alternatives: "What if instead of money, you offered...?"
4. If they can't align, consider their level of involvement in the intervention
5. Support other family members in maintaining boundaries despite disagreement

**Challenge: Professional Skepticism**

**Example:** The individual's therapist doesn't believe in formal interventions.

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Request a professional consultation call
2. Listen to their concerns and clinical perspective
3. Share your approach and how it can complement ongoing therapy
4. Find common ground in the shared goal of client wellness
5. If alignment isn't possible, respect their role and adjust your approach
6. Consider whether the family chooses to include or exclude them from the process

### Reflection Exercise: Coordination Challenges

**Think about a time when you had to coordinate multiple people with different opinions:**

1. What made it challenging?
2. How did you find common ground?
3. What would you do differently now with these frameworks?
