# Session 3.3A: Role-Play Round 1 (10:15–11:30 AM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

This is the heart of Day 3—**live intervention practice**. Two groups will present their intervention scenarios, each receiving 30 minutes of roleplay time plus 15 minutes of structured feedback. The remaining participants observe, take notes, and prepare to offer constructive feedback.

The goal of this session is to create a **safe, structured, and supportive environment** for practicing intervention skills. Participants will learn by doing, by watching, and by reflecting on what worked and what didn't.

## Why This Matters

You cannot learn intervention work from a book. You can only learn by practicing—by stepping into the role, feeling the emotional weight of it, navigating uncertainty in real time, and receiving feedback from peers who see what you cannot see in the moment.

Roleplays are not simulations of real interventions—they are **practice spaces** where mistakes are expected, welcomed, and used as learning opportunities. The feedback participants receive today will shape their practice for years to come.

## Facilitation Guide

**Opening Frame (5 minutes)**

Before the first roleplay begins, set the tone for the session:

> "We're about to begin the first round of roleplays. This is the moment you've been preparing for over the past two days. Before we start, I want to remind you of a few things:"

**Three Ground Rules for Roleplays:**

1. **This is practice, not performance.**
   - "You are allowed to make mistakes. In fact, you're supposed to make mistakes—that's how we learn. If you feel stuck during the roleplay, you can pause and ask for coaching. There are no perfect interventions."

2. **Stay in character until we call 'scene.'**
   - "Once the roleplay begins, commit to your role. Even if something feels awkward or unrealistic, stay with it. We'll debrief afterward."

3. **Feedback is a gift.**
   - "We're going to use a structured feedback model that starts with strengths, names what worked, and offers growth opportunities. Feedback is not criticism—it's care. Receive it with openness."

**Roleplay Structure (30 minutes per group)**

Each roleplay follows this structure:

**1. Setup (2 minutes)**
- The group introduces their scenario: who the Pivot Person is, who the family members are, what the family's goal is for the intervention.
- The interventionist briefly explains what intervention mode they are using (structured, collaborative, etc.).

**2. Roleplay (20 minutes)**
- The roleplay begins. Facilitators do **not** interrupt unless:
  - Someone is unsafe (emotionally or physically)
  - The roleplay has gone completely off track
  - Someone breaks character and asks for help

- Facilitators and observers take notes on:
  - What the interventionist did well
  - Effective moments (what worked)
  - Growth opportunities (what could be improved)

**3. Pause for Reflection (3 minutes)**
- After 20 minutes, call "scene."
- Ask the interventionist: *"How are you feeling? What was that like for you?"*
- Ask the Pivot Person: *"What was it like to be on the receiving end of that intervention?"*
- Ask the family members: *"What did you notice from your perspective?"*

**4. Structured Feedback (15 minutes)**
- Use the **Strengths → Effective Moments → Growth Opportunities** model (see below).

---

**Structured Feedback Model**

Feedback follows this sequence:

**Step 1: The interventionist reflects first (2 minutes)**

Ask the interventionist:

- "What do you think went well?"
- "What felt challenging?"
- "If you could do it again, what would you change?"

This step is critical—it allows the interventionist to process their own experience before receiving feedback from others.

---

**Step 2: Observers name strengths (3 minutes)**

Invite observers to name **specific strengths** they noticed. Use the prompt:

- "What did the interventionist do well?"

Examples of strengths to name:

- "You started with a clear, compassionate opening that created safety."
- "When the Pivot Person got defensive, you stayed calm and didn't take it personally."
- "You used reflective listening—'What I'm hearing is…'—which helped the Pivot Person feel heard."
- "You managed time well and kept the conversation focused."

Facilitator note: Do not allow vague praise ("You did great!"). Push for specificity: "What exactly did they do that was effective?"

---

**Step 3: Observers name effective moments (3 minutes)**

Invite observers to name **specific moments that worked**. Use the prompt:

- "What moments landed well? What interventions were particularly effective?"

Examples:

- "When the mother started crying, you paused and acknowledged her emotions before moving on. That was powerful."
- "When the Pivot Person said, 'I don't need help,' you didn't argue—you said, 'I hear you. Let's just listen to what your family has to say.' That was a great reframe."
- "The way you invited the father to speak first—that was strategic. His calm presence set a good tone."

---

**Step 4: Facilitators and observers offer growth opportunities (5 minutes)**

Now shift to constructive feedback. Use the phrase **"growth opportunities"** instead of "criticism" or "mistakes."

Examples:

- "One thing to consider: your opening was clear, but it felt a little rushed. Slowing down and making eye contact would create more connection."
- "When the Pivot Person interrupted a family member, you let it slide. In a real intervention, you'd want to gently redirect: 'Let's let Mom finish, and then I'll make sure you have time to respond.'"
- "I noticed you used a lot of clinical language—'substance use disorder,' 'treatment plan.' Families don't always connect with that language. Try values-based language instead: 'reconnecting with what matters most to you.'"

Facilitator note: Balance honesty with compassion. The goal is to help the person grow, not to make them feel inadequate.

---

**Step 5: Close with affirmation (2 minutes)**

End the feedback session by naming the courage it took to step into the role:

> "Thank you for your willingness to practice in front of the group. That takes real courage. You gave us all something to learn from."

---

**Repeat for Second Group**

Follow the same structure for the second group's roleplay.

---

## Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: Roleplays can be emotionally activating, especially for participants with personal history related to addiction or family conflict. Watch for signs of distress and offer the option to step out if needed.
- **Choice**: Participants should not be forced to continue a roleplay if it becomes overwhelming. Allow people to pause and step back.
- **Trustworthiness**: Honor the feedback structure. Do not allow feedback to become harsh or shaming.
- **Collaboration**: Emphasize that everyone is learning together—there are no experts in the room, just practitioners committed to growth.
- **Empowerment**: Name strengths explicitly and often. People learn best when they know what they are doing well, not just what needs improvement.

---

**Observation Notes for Participants**

While observing roleplays, participants should take notes using the workbook prompts:

**Scenario 1:**
- What the interventionist did well
- Effective moments (what worked)
- Growth opportunities (constructive feedback)

**Scenario 2:**
- What the interventionist did well
- Effective moments (what worked)
- Growth opportunities (constructive feedback)

These notes will inform group feedback and help participants internalize what effective intervention looks like.

---

**BREAK (11:30–11:45 AM — 15 minutes)**

After the intensity of two roleplays, participants need a reset. Encourage people to:

- Step outside for fresh air
- Stretch and move their bodies
- Hydrate and snack
- Decompress emotionally

Facilitator note: Check in with anyone who seemed distressed during the roleplays.
