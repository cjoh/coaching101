# Day 3 Reflection: Final Integration

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

The final reflection is a comprehensive integration exercise that helps participants synthesize the full 3-day training experience. This is completed individually, either at the end of Day 3 or as homework before the first mentorship call.
