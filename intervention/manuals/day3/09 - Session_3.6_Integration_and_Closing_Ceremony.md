# Session 3.6: Integration & Closing Ceremony (3:35–4:45 PM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

The final session of the training is about **integration, closure, and celebration**. Participants will synthesize their learning from the full 3-day experience, articulate their commitments to the work, and participate in a ceremonial closing that honors the journey they've taken together.

This session is designed to be reflective, emotional, and inspiring—sending participants into the world with clarity, confidence, and connection.

---

## Why This Matters

Endings matter. How we close a learning experience shapes what participants carry forward. The closing ceremony provides:

- **Closure**: A clear transition from training to practice
- **Integration**: Space to make meaning of the full 3-day experience
- **Commitment**: An opportunity to name intentions and accountability
- **Celebration**: Recognition of the courage, growth, and effort participants have shown
- **Connection**: A reminder that they are part of a community of practitioners

## Facilitation Guide

**Part 1: Letter to My Future Self (20 minutes)**

**Opening (3 minutes)**

> "You've spent three days learning, practicing, reflecting, and growing. You've built awareness of systems, learned how to coordinate care, and practiced intervention facilitation. Now, we're going to take time to integrate what you've learned by writing a letter to your future self."

Explain the purpose:

> "Six months from now, you'll be midway through your mentorship. You'll have facilitated interventions, encountered challenges, and grown in ways you can't yet imagine. This letter is a way to remind your future self what you learned here—what mattered, what you committed to, and what you hope to become."

---

**Reflection Prompts (15 minutes)**

Guide participants through the workbook prompts:

**1. Dear Future Me,**

> "Write to yourself six months from now. What do you want to remember from these 3 days? What commitments are you making? What hopes do you have for your development as an interventionist?"

Examples to spark reflection:

- "I hope you remember that intervention is about connection, not control."
- "I hope you've been kind to yourself when things didn't go as planned."
- "I hope you've stayed curious and asked for help when you needed it."
- "I hope you're still honoring the trust families place in you."

**2. Signed,**
**3. Today's date:**

Encourage participants to write from the heart—this is for them, not for anyone else.

Optional: Facilitators can collect these letters, seal them in envelopes, and mail them to participants at the 6-month mark as a surprise reminder.

---

**Part 2: Circle Closing Reflections (30 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "Now we're going to come together as a group for a closing circle. This is a time to share what you're taking with you, to name your commitments, and to express gratitude."

Arrange chairs in a circle if possible. This physical arrangement reinforces connection and equality.

---

**Round 1: What I'm taking with me (10 minutes)**

Invite each participant to share one thing they are taking with them from the training. Use the prompt:

> "What is one skill, insight, or connection you're taking forward?"

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly (1–2 minutes each).

Examples participants might name:

- "I'm taking the reminder that I don't have to have all the answers."
- "I'm taking the opening script I practiced today—I'll use that in my first intervention."
- "I'm taking the connection I feel with this group—it's powerful to not be alone in this work."

Facilitator note: Do not allow anyone to skip their turn. Gentle encouragement: "Take your time. What's one thing—even small—that shifted for you?"

---

**MICRO-BREAK (5 minutes — ~4:15 PM)**

> "Let's take a 5-minute break to stand, stretch, and reset before we continue."

---

**Round 2: My commitment to the families I'll serve (10 minutes)**

Invite each participant to share their commitment. Use the prompt:

> "How will you show up as an interventionist? What promise are you making to the families you'll serve?"

Examples:

- "I commit to showing up with humility, knowing that I don't have all the answers."
- "I commit to creating safety in every intervention—no coercion, only invitation."
- "I commit to ongoing learning and seeking supervision when I need it."
- "I commit to honoring the dignity of every person I serve, even when they say no."

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly.

---

**Round 3: Gratitude (8 minutes)**

Close the circle with gratitude. Invite each participant to express appreciation—for the group, for the facilitators, for the experience.

Examples:

- "I'm grateful for the vulnerability everyone brought to the roleplays—I learned so much from watching you."
- "I'm grateful for the facilitators' patience and wisdom."
- "I'm grateful for the reminder that I'm not alone in this work."

Go around the circle. Everyone shares briefly.

---

**Part 3: Ceremonial Closing (10 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "You've completed the Core Values Interventionist Training. You've learned the philosophy, practiced the skills, and built the foundation for your work as a guide for families in crisis. This is not the end—it's the beginning."

---

**Certificate Distribution (3 minutes)**

Distribute **Certificates of Completion** to each participant. Call each person by name and invite them to stand as they receive their certificate.

Optional: Take a group photo with certificates.

---

**Closing Blessing or Affirmation (5 minutes)**

Offer a closing blessing or affirmation that honors the work participants are stepping into:

> "May you intervene with compassion, guide with humility, and trust the process of connection. May you see systems, not symptoms. May you invite rather than coerce. May you coordinate care ethically and serve families with integrity. May you remember that intervention is not about perfection—it is about presence, courage, and care."

Pause.

> "You are ready. Not because you know everything, but because you are committed to learning. Welcome to the work."
