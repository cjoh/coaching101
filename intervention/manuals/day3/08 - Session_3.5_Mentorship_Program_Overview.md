# Session 3.5: Mentorship Program Overview (3:05–3:35 PM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

The 3-day training is just the beginning. To become a certified **Core Values Interventionist**, participants will complete a **40-week mentorship program** that includes ongoing supervision, case consultation, and accountability. This session provides a detailed overview of the mentorship structure, expectations, and next steps.

---

## Why This Matters

Intervention work is complex, high-stakes, and emotionally demanding. No one becomes a competent interventionist after three days of training. The mentorship program provides the **structure, support, and accountability** necessary for participants to develop their skills, build confidence, and practice ethically.

This session also serves as a **commitment checkpoint**. Participants need to understand what they are committing to and assess whether they have the time, resources, and readiness to complete the mentorship.

## Facilitation Guide

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin by acknowledging the transition from training to practice:

> "You've completed three days of intensive learning and practice. You've built awareness, learned coordination skills, and practiced intervention facilitation. But this is just the beginning. To become a certified Core Values Interventionist, you'll participate in a 40-week mentorship program that provides ongoing supervision and support as you build your practice."

**40-Week Mentorship Structure (15 minutes)**

Present the mentorship structure using the three-phase model:

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1–12)**

**Focus**: Learning by observation and supervised practice

**Activities**:
- **Weekly supervision calls** (30 minutes) with your Core Values mentor
- **Case observation**: Shadow experienced interventionists during live interventions
- **Skill development**: Practice specific skills (opening scripts, managing resistance, family communication)
- **Documentation**: Maintain a learning journal and case notes

**Outcomes**: By the end of Phase 1, participants should be able to:
- Articulate the Core Values model to families
- Facilitate a basic family meeting with supervision
- Recognize when they need support or consultation

**Phase 2: Guided Practice (Weeks 13–28)**

**Focus**: Co-facilitated interventions and case consultation

**Activities**:
- **Bi-weekly supervision calls** (45 minutes)
- **Co-facilitated interventions**: Lead interventions with mentor support

**Outcomes**: By the end of Phase 2, participants should be able to:
- Lead structured and collaborative interventions with mentor backup
- Navigate common challenges (resistance, family conflict, ambivalence)
- Coordinate care teams effectively

---

**Phase 3: Independent Practice (Weeks 29–40)**

**Focus**: Independent facilitation with supervision and final case review

**Activities**:
- **Monthly supervision calls** (60 minutes)
- **Lead interventions independently** with supervisor available for consultation

---

**Reflection: Preparing for Mentorship (5 minutes)**

Guide participants through the workbook reflection prompts:

1. **My availability for mentorship (weekly commitment):**
   - "What days and times can you commit to supervision calls and practice?"

2. **Learning goals for mentorship:**
   - "What do you want to develop during the 40 weeks?"

3. **Questions about mentorship program:**
   - "What clarifications do you need?"

4. **Support I'll need to complete mentorship:**
   - "What resources, accountability, or support will help you succeed?"

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share their learning goals or questions aloud.

---

**Closing the Session (2 minutes)**

> "The mentorship program is designed to support you—not to overwhelm you. You will not be alone in this work. You will have a mentor, a peer cohort, and access to resources. The goal is to help you build a sustainable, ethical, and effective intervention practice—one case at a time."

## Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Choice**: Participants should not feel pressured to commit to mentorship if they are not ready. Normalize the decision to wait or pursue other pathways.
- **Transparency**: Be clear about time, financial, and professional commitments. No surprises.
- **Empowerment**: Frame mentorship as an investment in their professional growth, not a requirement they "have to" complete.
