# Session 3.2: Trauma-Informed Practice & Case Prep (9:30–10:15 AM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

Before participants step into intervention roleplays, they need a **trauma-informed framework** to guide their practice. This session introduces the principles of trauma-informed care, explains how trauma shows up in intervention settings, and provides practical strategies for creating safety, choice, and empowerment.

The second half of the session transitions into **case preparation**, where participants finalize their roleplay scenarios, confirm roles, and rehearse their opening scripts.

---

## Why This Matters

Families in crisis are often carrying significant trauma—historical, intergenerational, and current. The Pivot Person may have experienced trauma related to their substance use (violence, overdose, legal consequences) or unrelated trauma that predates their addiction (childhood abuse, loss, systemic oppression).

If interventionists do not understand trauma, they risk **re-traumatizing** participants through coercive language, lack of choice, or failure to recognize trauma responses (dissociation, hypervigilance, shutdown).

Trauma-informed intervention is not just about being kind—it is about **creating conditions where healing is possible**. This requires intentionality, skill, and self-awareness.

## Facilitation Guide

**Part 1: Trauma-Informed Framework (20 minutes)**

**Opening (5 minutes)**

Begin with a brief framing of trauma in intervention work:

> "Intervention work brings us into contact with families in their most vulnerable moments. Many of the people we serve—both Pivot Persons and family members—are carrying significant trauma. As interventionists, our responsibility is not to provide trauma therapy—that is the role of licensed clinicians. But we must understand trauma so that we do not inadvertently cause harm."

Ask the group:

> "How many of you have experienced trauma in your own life?"

(Pause. Do not require anyone to answer aloud.)

> "How many of you have witnessed trauma responses in others—shutdown, anger, dissociation, hypervigilance?"

(Pause.)

> "Trauma is not rare. It is common. And it shapes how people respond to stress, vulnerability, and change. Today, we're going to learn how to recognize trauma responses and create safety in our intervention work."

**The 5 Principles of Trauma-Informed Care (10 minutes)**

Present the five principles of trauma-informed care using the acronym **STCCE**:

1. **Safety** — Physical and emotional safety for all participants
2. **Trustworthiness** — Consistency, transparency, and follow-through
3. **Choice** — Honoring autonomy and avoiding coercion
4. **Collaboration** — Shared decision-making and partnership
5. **Empowerment** — Recognizing strengths and building agency

For each principle, provide a specific example of how it applies to intervention work:

- **Safety**: "We start every intervention with a clear explanation of what will happen, who will speak, and what the Pivot Person can expect. We do not surprise or ambush."
- **Trustworthiness**: "We follow through on what we say. If we tell the Pivot Person they can take a break, we honor that—even if it interrupts the flow of the intervention."
- **Choice**: "We invite, we do not coerce. The Pivot Person always has the choice to say no. Our job is to create conditions where 'yes' becomes possible, not to force it."
- **Collaboration**: "We involve the Pivot Person in decision-making. We ask, 'What would feel most helpful to you right now?' rather than dictating the process."
- **Empowerment**: "We reflect strengths, not just problems. We remind the Pivot Person of their resilience, their values, and their capacity for change."

**Recognizing Trauma Responses (5 minutes)**

Explain common trauma responses that may show up during interventions:

- **Fight**: Anger, defensiveness, blame, aggression
- **Flight**: Avoidance, leaving the room, shutting down conversation
- **Freeze**: Dissociation, numbness, emotional flatness, silence
- **Fawn**: People-pleasing, false compliance, saying "yes" without meaning it

Emphasize:

> "None of these responses are personal. They are survival strategies. When someone becomes defensive or shuts down, they are not 'resisting change'—they are responding to perceived threat. Our job is to reduce the threat by creating safety."

**Practical Application:**

Ask participants to reflect:

> "In your workbook, write down: What signs of trauma might you see during interventions? How will you create safety in today's roleplays?"

Allow 3 minutes for individual reflection. Invite a few participants to share their responses aloud.

**Part 2: Case Study Preparation (25 minutes)**

**Transition (2 minutes)**

> "Now we're going to shift from theory to practice. Each group has been working on a case study over the past two days. It's time to finalize your scenario and prepare for the roleplay."

**Group Work Time (20 minutes)**

Break participants into their roleplay groups (3–5 people per group). Each group should have:

- A case study scenario (provided on Day 1 or Day 2)
- Assigned roles (Interventionist, Pivot Person, family members)
- A confirmed intervention mode (structured, collaborative, crisis, etc.)

Guide groups through the following preparation steps:

1. **Confirm the intervention mode:**
   - What type of intervention are you practicing? (Structured family meeting, collaborative check-in, crisis intervention, etc.)

2. **Review the scenario details:**
   - Who is the Pivot Person? What is their substance use pattern?
   - Who are the family members? What are their relationships and roles?
   - What is the family's goal for the intervention?

3. **Assign roles clearly:**
   - Who is facilitating as the interventionist?
   - Who is playing the Pivot Person?
   - Who are the family members?
   - Is there a co-facilitator or observer?

4. **Rehearse the opening script:**
   - The interventionist should practice their opening 2–3 times. This is the most important moment of the intervention—it sets the tone for everything that follows.
   - Example opening: *"Thank you for being here. I know this is hard. Today, the people who love you most want to share what they've been experiencing and talk about next steps. You don't have to agree with everything you hear, and you don't have to make any decisions right now. What we're asking is that you listen with an open heart."*

5. **Plan the speaker order:**
   - Who speaks first? Second? Third?
   - What are the key points each family member wants to express?
   - Reminder: Family members should speak from **values and connection**, not blame or shame.

6. **Readiness check:**
   - On a scale of 1–10, how ready does each person feel?
   - What support does the group need from facilitators or observers?

**Facilitator Coaching (3 minutes)**

Walk around the room during group work time. Check in with each group. Offer coaching on:

- Opening scripts that feel too clinical or too informal
- Family member letters that slip into blame or shame
- Interventionists who seem uncertain or overwhelmed

Provide specific, actionable feedback:

- "That opening is great, but let's slow it down. Pause after 'thank you for being here' and make eye contact before continuing."
- "That family member statement is powerful, but let's reframe 'You're destroying this family' to 'I feel like we're losing connection with you, and that scares me.'"

---

**Close the Session (2 minutes)**

> "You've done excellent preparation work. In a few minutes, we're going to begin the first round of roleplays. Remember: this is practice. You are allowed to make mistakes. You are allowed to pause and ask for coaching. The goal is not perfection—it's learning."

## Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: Participants may feel vulnerable stepping into emotionally intense roles. Normalize nervousness and offer permission to pause or modify roles if needed.
- **Choice**: No one should be forced to play a role that feels triggering. Offer alternative roles (observer, note-taker) if someone needs to step back.
- **Collaboration**: Groups should work together to prepare, not compete. Emphasize that everyone is learning together.
- **Empowerment**: Recognize the courage it takes to practice in front of peers. Name it explicitly: "This is brave work."
