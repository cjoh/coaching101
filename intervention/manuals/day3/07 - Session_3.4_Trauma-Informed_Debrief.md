# Session 3.4: Trauma-Informed Debrief (1:45–2:45 PM)

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Purpose

The afternoon begins with a **trauma-informed debrief**—a structured process for helping participants process the emotional and psychological impact of the morning's roleplays. This session is not about feedback or analysis—it is about **emotional integration, self-care, and making meaning** of what came up.

Intervention work is emotionally demanding. Participants may have experienced activation, triggers, or personal connections to the scenarios. The debrief creates space to acknowledge these responses, normalize them, and develop self-care strategies for managing the emotional weight of this work.

---

## Why This Matters

Without proper debriefing, participants may carry unprocessed emotions into future work—leading to burnout, compassion fatigue, or secondary trauma. Trauma-informed debriefing teaches participants **how to care for themselves** so they can sustainably care for others.

This session also reinforces the principle that **self-awareness is a professional competency**. Effective interventionists know their triggers, manage their emotions, and seek support when needed.

## Facilitation Guide

**Opening Frame (5 minutes)**

Begin with a grounding exercise:

> "This morning was intense. You stepped into emotionally challenging roles, witnessed difficult family dynamics, and practiced skills that felt unfamiliar. Before we move forward, we need to pause and process what came up. This is not optional—it's essential. If we don't process the emotional weight of this work, we carry it with us, and it becomes a burden."

Lead a brief grounding practice:

- "Close your eyes and take three deep breaths."
- "Notice where you are. Notice that you are safe."
- "Notice any emotions or sensations in your body—tightness, tension, sadness, fatigue. Just notice, without judgment."
- "Take one more deep breath and open your eyes when you're ready."

**TiPS Framework: Processing the Roleplay Experience (30 minutes)**

Introduce the **TiPS framework (Trauma-informed Practice Strategies)** for processing intense experiences:

**T — Feelings and reactions that came up**
**i — Connections to my own story**
**P — Self-care plan**
**S — When to seek support**

Guide participants through each component:

---

**1. What feelings or reactions came up for me (10 minutes)**

Ask participants to reflect individually:

> "What emotions or reactions came up during the roleplays? This could be during your own roleplay or while observing others. There are no wrong answers."

Examples to normalize:

- Sadness or grief (recognizing the pain families experience)
- Anger or frustration (at the Pivot Person, at enabling family members)
- Anxiety or overwhelm (feeling the weight of responsibility)
- Disconnection or numbness (a trauma response to emotional intensity)
- Joy or hope (witnessing connection and vulnerability)

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share aloud. Use prompts:

- "Who's willing to name one emotion that came up for you today?"
- "What body sensations did you notice? Tightness? Tears? Fatigue?"

Facilitator note: Do not force anyone to share. Create space, then honor silence.

---

**2. Connections to my own story (10 minutes)**

> "Sometimes, intervention work touches our own stories—our own experiences with addiction, family conflict, or loss. If anything in today's roleplays resonated with your personal experience, take a moment to name it."

Examples:

- "The Pivot Person's resistance reminded me of my own resistance when my family tried to help me."
- "The mother's grief brought up my own feelings about losing someone to addiction."
- "I noticed myself getting defensive when the family member used shaming language—because I've been on the receiving end of that."

Emphasize:

> "These connections are not weaknesses—they are part of what makes you effective as an interventionist. Your lived experience is an asset. But we have to be aware of when our own story is influencing our reactions so it doesn't cloud our judgment."

After individual reflection, invite a few participants to share if they feel comfortable.

---

**3. How I'll care for myself after intense practice (5 minutes)**

> "Intervention work takes a toll. If you don't care for yourself, you will burn out. Self-care is not optional—it is a professional responsibility."

Ask participants to write down at least **three self-care strategies** they will use today and in future intervention work. Examples:

- Physical: exercise, sleep, nutrition, movement
- Emotional: talking to a friend, journaling, therapy, peer support
- Spiritual: meditation, prayer, time in nature, creative expression
- Professional: supervision, consultation, peer debriefing

---

**4. When I'll seek consultation or supervision (5 minutes)**

> "You will not be able to handle every intervention alone. Knowing when to seek support is a sign of competence, not weakness."

Ask participants to reflect:

> "What red flags would tell you that you need consultation or supervision?"

Examples to name:

- A case that triggers your own trauma or strong emotional reactions
- A Pivot Person who is suicidal or at immediate risk of harm
- Family dynamics that feel unsafe or abusive
- Uncertainty about your role or scope of practice
- Feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or emotionally depleted

Emphasize:

> "If you don't know what to do, you ask. If you feel out of your depth, you ask. If something feels ethically murky, you ask. That's what the 40-week mentorship is for—so you never have to figure this out alone."

---

**Trauma-Informed Interventionist Practice (15 minutes)**

Transition from personal processing to professional application:

> "Now that we've processed our own responses, let's talk about how we apply trauma-informed care in real intervention settings."

---

**Discussion Prompt 1: Signs of trauma I might see in intervention work**

Ask participants:

> "What signs of trauma might you see when working with families?"

Examples to name:

- **In Pivot Persons**: defensiveness, dissociation, emotional shutdown, hypervigilance, self-blame
- **In family members**: anger, enabling behaviors, emotional flooding, caretaking, avoidance
- **In the system**: triangulation (two people talking about a third), scapegoating, rigid roles, lack of boundaries

---

**Discussion Prompt 2: How I'll create safety in intervention settings**

Ask participants:

> "How will you create safety during interventions?"

Examples to name:

- **Language**: Use invitational language ("Would you be willing to…") rather than commands
- **Pacing**: Slow down. Pause between speakers. Allow silence.
- **Choice**: Remind the Pivot Person they can take breaks, ask questions, or stop the intervention if needed
- **Control**: Give the Pivot Person as much control as possible over the process (where they sit, who speaks first, etc.)
- **Transparency**: Explain what will happen, who will be there, and what the family is hoping for

---

**Discussion Prompt 3: When I'll seek consultation or supervision**

Reinforce the earlier reflection by asking:

> "What situations would make you reach out for consultation or supervision?"

Examples:

- Complex cases involving co-occurring disorders (mental health + substance use)
- Cases involving domestic violence, child abuse, or other safety concerns
- Cases where you feel personally triggered or emotionally reactive
- Cases where the family has unrealistic expectations (e.g., "We want you to force them into treatment")

Close the section:

> "Trauma-informed intervention is not about having all the answers. It's about creating conditions where healing becomes possible—and knowing when you need support to do that well."

---

## Trauma-Informed Considerations

- **Safety**: This session may bring up difficult emotions. Have tissues available, normalize tears, and offer permission to step out if needed.
- **Choice**: Participants should not be required to share personal connections to the work. Honor privacy.
- **Trustworthiness**: Model the self-care and boundary-setting you are teaching. If you as a facilitator are exhausted, name it: "I need to take a short break before we continue."
- **Collaboration**: Emphasize that everyone in the room is learning together—facilitators included.
- **Empowerment**: Reinforce that self-awareness is a strength, not a weakness. Knowing your limits is part of being a competent interventionist.

---

**BREAK (2:45–3:05 PM — 20 minutes)**

This is an extended break after emotionally heavy content. Encourage participants to:

- Step outside
- Move their bodies
- Call a friend or support person if needed
- Rest
