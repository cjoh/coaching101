# Day 3: Care — Practice, Integration, and Reflection

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Overview: The Day of Practice

Welcome to Day 3—**Care**. After two days of building awareness and learning coordination skills, today is about **embodiment**. This is the day you step into the role of interventionist through live practice, receive feedback from peers and facilitators, process the emotional weight of this work, and prepare for the 40-week mentorship journey ahead.

Today is not about perfection. It is about **presence, courage, and integration**. You will practice facilitating interventions through structured roleplays, navigate complex family dynamics in real time, and learn what it feels like to hold space for families in crisis. You will also discover your strengths, identify your growing edges, and build the foundation for ongoing learning.

### What Makes Day 3 Different

The first two days were about **learning**. Today is about **doing**.

You will move from theory to practice, from observation to facilitation, from understanding to embodiment. The roleplays you participate in today will be challenging—they are designed to surface the complexity, uncertainty, and emotional intensity of real intervention work. This is intentional. We practice hard things in safe spaces so that when you sit with real families, you are prepared.

**Care** is the third pillar of Core Values intervention. It is where awareness and coordination come together in service of families. Care is not soft—it is rigorous, adaptive, and accountable. It requires vulnerability, humility, and the courage to stay present even when outcomes are uncertain.
