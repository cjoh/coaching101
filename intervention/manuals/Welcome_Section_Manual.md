# Welcome to Core Values Interventionist Training

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

## Program Overview

Welcome to the **Core Values Interventionist Training**—a transformative 3-day immersive program designed to prepare you to guide families from crisis to connection. This training equips you with the knowledge, skills, and ethical framework to serve as a professional interventionist who sees systems, builds collaboration, and honors the dignity of every person touched by addiction and recovery.

### What Is This Training?

This is an advanced professional training for individuals with recovery experience and professional backgrounds in coaching, therapy, or peer support. Over three intensive days, you will learn the Core Values model of intervention—a philosophy and practice that views intervention not as a confrontation, but as a **guided process of connection** that brings together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move from crisis to recovery.

Unlike traditional intervention models that focus on coercion or control, Core Values intervention is rooted in **invitation, collaboration, and dignity**. You will learn to work with entire family systems, coordinate multidisciplinary care teams, and facilitate communication that honors the humanity of everyone involved.

### Who Is This Training For?

This training is designed for:

- **Recovery coaches** seeking to expand their practice to family intervention work
- **Therapists and counselors** who want to incorporate intervention coordination into their clinical work
- **Peer support professionals** with lived experience who are ready to serve families in crisis
- **Experienced practitioners** looking to deepen their understanding of systems-based intervention
- **Anyone committed to ethical, family-centered care** in the recovery space

**Prerequisites**: Participants should have recovery experience (personal or professional), a foundational understanding of addiction and recovery, and a commitment to practicing within ethical boundaries.

### What Makes This Training Different

The Core Values approach to intervention stands apart from traditional models in several key ways:

#### **See Systems, Not Symptoms**

We recognize that addiction impacts entire family systems, not just the individual struggling with substance use. Recovery belongs to the whole family. As an interventionist, you will learn to see the interconnections, patterns, and relationships that shape crisis and recovery—and to work with families as collaborative partners, not passive recipients of your expertise.

#### **Invite Rather Than Coerce**

Traditional intervention often relies on ultimatums, pressure, and confrontation. Core Values intervention is built on **invitation and connection**. You will learn to create conditions where change becomes possible through dignity, respect, and honest communication—not through manipulation or control.

#### **Coordinate Care Ethically**

Professional interventionists serve as **care coordinators** who bring together multidisciplinary teams (therapists, coaches, medical professionals, peer support, family members) to create comprehensive recovery plans. Critically, Core Values interventionists maintain **ethical independence**—we have no financial interest in treatment placements or outcomes. Your loyalty is to the family, not to referral fees.

#### **Practice Adaptive Intervention**

There is no formula. Every family requires a personalized path. You will learn to meet families where they are, adapt your approach based on what they need, and remain flexible as circumstances change. Intervention is not a script—it is a dynamic, responsive practice grounded in awareness, coordination, and care.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this training, you will be able to demonstrate competency in the following areas:

### 1. Define and Describe the Core Values Model of Intervention

You will articulate the philosophy, values, and practices that distinguish Core Values intervention from other approaches. This includes understanding intervention as a **process of connection** rather than confrontation, and recognizing that recovery is lifelong and belongs to the whole family system.

**Example**: You will be able to explain to a family why we use the term "Pivot Person" instead of "addict" or "person of concern," and how language shapes dignity and hope in the intervention process.

---

### 2. Identify Distinctions and Overlaps Between Professional Roles

You will clearly differentiate the roles of Interventionists, Coaches, Therapists, Sponsors, and Peer Professionals—understanding where these roles overlap and where they diverge. This clarity prevents role confusion and ensures ethical, effective collaboration.

**Example**: You will know when a family needs clinical therapy (trauma processing, diagnosis) versus coaching (accountability, goal-setting) versus peer support (shared experience, connection)—and how to coordinate all three without overstepping your scope.

---

### 3. Apply Systems Theory to Intervention

You will understand how family systems operate—recognizing patterns of communication, power dynamics, triangulation, enabling, and resilience. You will see how individual behavior is shaped by relationships and how recovery requires systemic change, not just individual willpower.

**Example**: In a case study, you will identify how a mother's overprotection, a father's detachment, and a sibling's resentment all contribute to the Pivot Person's resistance to help—and you will design interventions that address the system, not just the individual.

---

### 4. Demonstrate Ethical Alignment with the Core Values Code of Ethics

You will embody the principles of **Integrity, Humility, Service, and Connection** in all aspects of your work. This includes maintaining boundaries, avoiding conflicts of interest, honoring confidentiality, and always prioritizing the family's wellbeing over financial gain.

**Example**: You will recognize when a treatment center offers you a referral fee—and you will decline, explaining to the family why your independence is essential to their trust and your effectiveness.

---

### 5. Develop Coordinated Intervention Plans

You will create comprehensive, personalized intervention plans that honor dignity, invitation, and connection. These plans will include assessment of the family system, identification of care team members, communication strategies, and contingency planning for multiple outcomes.

**Example**: You will design an intervention plan that includes a family meeting script, roles for each participant, connection to detox and outpatient services, coordination with the Pivot Person's therapist, and a follow-up plan for ongoing family coaching—all without assuming the Pivot Person will say "yes" immediately.

---

### 6. Facilitate Family Communication

You will guide families through difficult conversations with skill, compassion, and structure. This includes managing emotions, de-escalating conflict, reframing blame into accountability, and creating space for honest expression without coercion.

**Example**: When a family member says, "If you loved us, you'd just stop using," you will gently redirect toward values-based language: "What I hear is that you feel afraid and disconnected. Let's talk about what connection and safety would look like for everyone."

---

### 7. Collaborate Effectively with Multidisciplinary Teams

You will build and coordinate care networks that include therapists, coaches, medical professionals, peer support specialists, and family members. You will use shared language, respect professional boundaries, and ensure everyone is working toward aligned goals.

**Example**: You will schedule a care team meeting with the Pivot Person's therapist, recovery coach, and family doctor—facilitating a conversation about medication-assisted treatment, trauma-informed therapy, and family coaching without overstepping into clinical decision-making.

---

### 8. Integrate Core Values Language in Communication

You will use the specific terminology of the Core Values Recovery system in all your work—language that reframes shame into dignity, blame into accountability, and coercion into invitation. This includes terms like "Pivot Person," "Healthy Choices," and "Recovery is a Team Sport."

**Example**: Instead of saying, "Your son needs to set boundaries with his drug-using friends," you will say, "Your son is learning to make Healthy Choices about who he spends time with—and the family can support that by modeling connection and respect."

---

### 9. Lead Structured Family Case Studies

You will facilitate group discussions and reflections using real-world case studies. This includes presenting scenarios, eliciting participant insights, guiding ethical analysis, and helping others learn from both successes and failures.

**Example**: During the training, you will present a case study of a failed intervention—analyzing what went wrong, what could have been done differently, and what lessons the group can apply to their own practice.

---

### 10. Prepare for 40-Week Mentorship

You will understand the structure, expectations, and commitments of the 40-week mentorship program that follows this training. This includes clarity on supervision requirements, case consultations, ethical accountability, and the path toward Core Values Interventionist certification.

**Example**: You will know that mentorship includes monthly one-on-one supervision, quarterly group case reviews, and documentation of at least 10 intervention cases—and you will be able to articulate why this ongoing support is essential to competent, ethical practice.

## Core Values Intervention Philosophy

### What Is Intervention?

> **"Intervention is a guided process of connection—bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move from crisis to recovery. The outcome of intervention is connection, honesty, and hope."**

Intervention is not an event. It is not a surprise ambush or a last-ditch effort to force someone into treatment. Intervention is a **process**—one that begins long before a family meeting and continues long after the Pivot Person enters (or declines) treatment.

At its core, intervention is about **connection**:

- **Connection to self**: Helping the Pivot Person reconnect with their values, identity, and sense of meaning
- **Connection to family**: Repairing broken relationships and rebuilding trust
- **Connection to care**: Coordinating a network of professionals who can provide the right support at the right time
- **Connection to hope**: Creating belief that recovery is possible, even when the path is unclear

The Core Values model recognizes that intervention is not something we do **to** someone—it is something we do **with** them, and with their family. The interventionist is not the hero of the story. The interventionist is a guide, a facilitator, a coordinator—someone who helps the family see what they already have and build what they need.

### The Three Pillars of Core Values Intervention

The Core Values approach is built on three foundational pillars that structure the training and guide your practice:

#### **🪞 Awareness: The Foundation of Connection**

Awareness is the capacity to see clearly—to understand systems, recognize patterns, and build perspective. As an interventionist, you will develop awareness of:

- **Family systems**: How relationships, roles, and dynamics shape behavior and recovery
- **Your own biases**: What you bring into the room based on your own recovery story, professional background, and cultural lens
- **Context and culture**: How race, class, gender, trauma, and identity impact how families experience crisis and healing
- **Complexity**: The reality that there are no simple answers, no guaranteed outcomes, and no one-size-fits-all solutions

Awareness means slowing down before acting. It means listening before speaking. It means recognizing that what you see is not always the full picture—and that curiosity is more valuable than certainty.

**Day 1 of the training** is dedicated to building this foundational awareness.

---

#### **🧭 Coordination: The Architecture of Care**

Coordination is the work of bringing people, resources, and systems together in service of recovery. As an interventionist, you will learn to:

- **Build care teams**: Identify and connect the right professionals (therapists, coaches, medical providers, peer support) for each family's unique needs
- **Maintain ethical boundaries**: Understand your scope of practice and when to defer to clinical, medical, or peer expertise
- **Navigate conflicts of interest**: Avoid financial entanglements that compromise your independence and the family's trust
- **Facilitate collaboration**: Use shared language and aligned goals to ensure everyone is working together, not in silos

Coordination is the bridge between awareness and action. It is the architecture that holds the intervention together—ensuring that the family is not left to navigate the fragmented recovery system alone.

**Day 2 of the training** focuses on building these coordination skills.

---

#### **🗼 Care: Practice & Integration**

Care is the embodiment of awareness and coordination in real-world practice. It is meeting families where they are, adapting your approach to what they need, and maintaining presence even when outcomes are uncertain. As an interventionist, you will practice:

- **Adaptive intervention**: Tailoring your approach to each family's unique circumstances, values, and readiness
- **Skillful communication**: Facilitating difficult conversations with compassion, structure, and clarity
- **Ethical decision-making**: Navigating gray areas, managing complexity, and staying aligned with Core Values principles
- **Reflective practice**: Learning from every case, seeking supervision, and committing to continuous growth

Care is not soft. Care is rigorous, disciplined, and accountable. It requires vulnerability, humility, and the courage to sit with families in their pain without trying to fix it.

**Day 3 of the training** is dedicated to practicing and integrating these skills through live roleplay, case consultation, and group reflection.

---

### What Makes Core Values Different

The Core Values approach to intervention is grounded in five core principles that distinguish it from traditional models:

#### **1. Intervention Is Part of Recovery, and Recovery Is Lifelong**

Intervention is not a separate event that happens before recovery begins. Intervention **is** recovery. It is the first step in a lifelong process of reclaiming connection to values, meaning, and purpose. This means that the interventionist's role does not end when the Pivot Person enters treatment—it evolves into ongoing coordination, support, and family care.

---

#### **2. There Is No Formula**

Every family is different. Every Pivot Person is different. Every intervention requires a personalized path. While we teach frameworks, models, and best practices, the Core Values approach rejects rigid scripts and one-size-fits-all formulas. You will learn to assess, adapt, and respond to what each family needs in the moment.

---

#### **3. Invitation Over Coercion**

We do not manipulate, pressure, or force Pivot Persons into treatment. We create conditions where change becomes possible through dignity, respect, and honest communication. This means honoring the Pivot Person's autonomy even when their choices are painful for the family—and trusting that invitation is more powerful than control.

---

#### **4. Recovery Is a Team Sport**

The whole family participates in recovery. This means the interventionist does not just focus on the Pivot Person—you work with the entire system. Parents, siblings, partners, children, extended family members—everyone has a role to play. And recovery does not belong to just the Pivot Person; it belongs to the family as a whole.

---

#### **5. Ethical Independence**

Core Values interventionists have **no financial interest in treatment outcomes**. We do not accept referral fees, kickbacks, or commissions from treatment centers. Our loyalty is to the family, not to financial incentives. This independence is essential to maintaining trust, ethical practice, and credibility.
