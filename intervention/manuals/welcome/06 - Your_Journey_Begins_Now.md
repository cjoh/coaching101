## Your Journey Begins Now

You are about to embark on a journey that will challenge you, stretch you, and transform how you understand recovery work. Intervention is not easy. It requires courage, humility, and a willingness to sit with complexity. But it is also deeply meaningful—an opportunity to serve families in their most vulnerable moments and help them move from crisis to connection.

As you move through this training, remember:

- **You are not alone**: You are part of a community of practitioners committed to ethical, family-centered care
- **There is no perfection**: You will make mistakes, and that is how you will learn
- **Connection is the outcome**: Success is not measured by whether the Pivot Person says "yes" to treatment—it is measured by whether the family feels seen, heard, and supported

Welcome to the work. Welcome to the journey. Welcome to Core Values Intervention.
