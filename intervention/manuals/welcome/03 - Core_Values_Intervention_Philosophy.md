## Core Values Intervention Philosophy

### What Is Intervention?

> **"Intervention is a guided process of connectionâ€”bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move from crisis to recovery. The outcome of intervention is connection, honesty, and hope."**

Intervention is not an event. It is not a surprise ambush or a last-ditch effort to force someone into treatment. Intervention is a **process**â€”one that begins long before a family meeting and continues long after the Pivot Person enters (or declines) treatment.

At its core, intervention is about **connection**:

- **Connection to self**: Helping the Pivot Person reconnect with their values, identity, and sense of meaning
- **Connection to family**: Repairing broken relationships and rebuilding trust
- **Connection to care**: Coordinating a network of professionals who can provide the right support at the right time
- **Connection to hope**: Creating belief that recovery is possible, even when the path is unclear

The Core Values model recognizes that intervention is not something we do **to** someoneâ€”it is something we do **with** them, and with their family. The interventionist is not the hero of the story. The interventionist is a guide, a facilitator, a coordinatorâ€”someone who helps the family see what they already have and build what they need.

### The Three Pillars of Core Values Intervention

The Core Values approach is built on three foundational pillars that structure the training and guide your practice:

#### **ðŸªž Awareness: The Foundation of Connection**

Awareness is the capacity to see clearlyâ€”to understand systems, recognize patterns, and build perspective. As an interventionist, you will develop awareness of:

- **Family systems**: How relationships, roles, and dynamics shape behavior and recovery
- **Your own biases**: What you bring into the room based on your own recovery story, professional background, and cultural lens
- **Context and culture**: How race, class, gender, trauma, and identity impact how families experience crisis and healing
- **Complexity**: The reality that there are no simple answers, no guaranteed outcomes, and no one-size-fits-all solutions

Awareness means slowing down before acting. It means listening before speaking. It means recognizing that what you see is not always the full pictureâ€”and that curiosity is more valuable than certainty.

**Day 1 of the training** is dedicated to building this foundational awareness.

#### **ðŸ§­ Coordination: The Architecture of Care**

Coordination is the work of bringing people, resources, and systems together in service of recovery. As an interventionist, you will learn to:

- **Build care teams**: Identify and connect the right professionals (therapists, coaches, medical providers, peer support) for each family's unique needs
- **Maintain ethical boundaries**: Understand your scope of practice and when to defer to clinical, medical, or peer expertise
- **Navigate conflicts of interest**: Avoid financial entanglements that compromise your independence and the family's trust
- **Facilitate collaboration**: Use shared language and aligned goals to ensure everyone is working together, not in silos

Coordination is the bridge between awareness and action. It is the architecture that holds the intervention togetherâ€”ensuring that the family is not left to navigate the fragmented recovery system alone.

**Day 2 of the training** focuses on building these coordination skills.

#### **ðŸ—¼ Care: Practice & Integration**

Care is the embodiment of awareness and coordination in real-world practice. It is meeting families where they are, adapting your approach to what they need, and maintaining presence even when outcomes are uncertain. As an interventionist, you will practice:

- **Adaptive intervention**: Tailoring your approach to each family's unique circumstances, values, and readiness
- **Skillful communication**: Facilitating difficult conversations with compassion, structure, and clarity
- **Ethical decision-making**: Navigating gray areas, managing complexity, and staying aligned with Core Values principles
- **Reflective practice**: Learning from every case, seeking supervision, and committing to continuous growth

Care is not soft. Care is rigorous, disciplined, and accountable. It requires vulnerability, humility, and the courage to sit with families in their pain without trying to fix it.

**Day 3 of the training** is dedicated to practicing and integrating these skills through live roleplay, case consultation, and group reflection.

### What Makes Core Values Different

The Core Values approach to intervention is grounded in five core principles that distinguish it from traditional models:

#### **1. Intervention Is Part of Recovery, and Recovery Is Lifelong**

Intervention is not a separate event that happens before recovery begins. Intervention **is** recovery. It is the first step in a lifelong process of reclaiming connection to values, meaning, and purpose. This means that the interventionist's role does not end when the Pivot Person enters treatmentâ€”it evolves into ongoing coordination, support, and family care.

---

#### **2. There Is No Formula**

Every family is different. Every Pivot Person is different. Every intervention requires a personalized path. While we teach frameworks, models, and best practices, the Core Values approach rejects rigid scripts and one-size-fits-all formulas. You will learn to assess, adapt, and respond to what each family needs in the moment.

---

#### **3. Invitation Over Coercion**

We do not manipulate, pressure, or force Pivot Persons into treatment. We create conditions where change becomes possible through dignity, respect, and honest communication. This means honoring the Pivot Person's autonomy even when their choices are painful for the familyâ€”and trusting that invitation is more powerful than control.

---

#### **4. Recovery Is a Team Sport**

The whole family participates in recovery. This means the interventionist does not just focus on the Pivot Personâ€”you work with the entire system. Parents, siblings, partners, children, extended family membersâ€”everyone has a role to play. And recovery does not belong to just the Pivot Person; it belongs to the family as a whole.

---

#### **5. Ethical Independence**

Core Values interventionists have **no financial interest in treatment outcomes**. We do not accept referral fees, kickbacks, or commissions from treatment centers. Our loyalty is to the family, not to financial incentives. This independence is essential to maintaining trust, ethical practice, and credibility.
