# Session 1.4: The ARISE Continuum (60 minutes)

## Purpose

This session introduces the ARISE Intervention model, an evidence-based approach that honors autonomy while creating powerful motivation for change. Understanding this continuum helps you meet families where they are and guide them through a structured process.

## ARISE Overview (20 minutes)

**What Is ARISE?**

ARISE stands for **A Relational Intervention Sequence for Engagement**. Developed by Dr. Judith Landau, it's an evidence-based model that:
- Engages 83% of identified patients in treatment (compared to 30% for traditional interventions)
- Reduces harm to both the person struggling and their family
- Works through progressive levels of involvement
- Starts with invitation rather than confrontation

**The Core Principle:**

ARISE recognizes that people are more likely to change when they're invited into a process rather than ambushed by one. It begins with the assumption that the person struggling probably wants help at some level—they just need the right conditions to access that desire.

**The Three Levels:**

**Level 1: First Call** (60-70% success rate)
- The person struggling is invited to the first planning meeting
- No confrontation, no surprise—just an invitation to participate in solving the problem
- Even if they don't come, the family learns how to change the system in ways that reduce enabling

**Level 2: Strength-Based Intervention** (15-20% additional success)
- If Level 1 doesn't work, the family continues meeting without the person
- They focus on their own changes and healing
- They prepare for a structured family meeting
- The person is invited (with full transparency) to a meeting where concerns will be shared

**Level 3: Traditional Intervention** (additional 5-10% success)
- If Levels 1 and 2 haven't worked, a more structured intervention is planned
- This looks more like traditional intervention but with all the groundwork laid
- Still values-based, still honoring dignity and autonomy as much as possible

**Why This Sequence Matters:**

Traditional intervention often starts at Level 3—the confrontational, high-stakes family meeting. ARISE recognizes that:
- Most people don't need that level of intensity
- Starting gently allows for less damage to relationships
- The process itself can create change even if treatment isn't immediately accepted
- Families heal through participation in the process

**The Paradigm Shift:**

Traditional model: "We need to break through their denial and force them to see reality."

ARISE model: "This person is struggling and the system around them is struggling too. Let's invite them into a collaborative process of healing for everyone."

**Reflection Prompts:**
- How does this approach differ from what you expected intervention to be?
- What feels more comfortable about starting with Level 1? What feels more challenging?
- How might this approach honor the core values of dignity and autonomy?

## Level 1: The First Call (15 minutes)

**What Happens:**

When a family first contacts you, you conduct a thorough assessment and then invite the person struggling to participate in the first meeting. This is revolutionary—in traditional models, the person struggling is kept in the dark until the intervention itself.

**The Invitation:**

The family says something like: "We've been worried about your drinking. We've contacted an interventionist to help us figure out how to support you. We'd like you to come to the first meeting so we can do this together as a family. Will you come?"

**Three Possible Responses:**

**1. "Yes, I'll come."** (This happens more often than you'd think)
- The person participates in planning their own treatment
- The family is empowered and united
- You facilitate a collaborative conversation
- Success rate: Very high when the person shows up

**2. "No, there's no problem."**
- The person declines but now knows the family is taking action
- The system begins to shift even without their participation
- You move to Level 2
- The person may change their mind after seeing the family's commitment

**3. "I'll think about it."**
- You keep the door open
- The family continues with their own work
- You may circle back to Level 1 before moving to Level 2

**What the Family Learns:**

Even when the person doesn't come to Level 1, the family begins learning:
- How to communicate clearly and calmly about their concerns
- How to stop enabling
- How to take care of themselves
- How to create natural consequences

This learning is valuable regardless of whether the person enters treatment immediately.

**Your Role:**

At Level 1, you're facilitating a collaborative family problem-solving process, not conducting an intervention in the traditional sense. You're:
- Creating safety for honest conversation
- Teaching communication skills
- Helping identify enabling patterns
- Developing a plan everyone can agree on

## Level 2: Strength-Based Intervention (15 minutes)

**When You Move to Level 2:**

If the person doesn't come to Level 1 meetings, or comes but isn't ready to accept help, you move to Level 2. This involves:
- Continued family meetings (usually 2-4 sessions)
- Family members working on their own healing
- Preparing for a more formal family meeting with the person
- Building motivation through changed family dynamics

**What's Different from Level 1:**

**Level 1** was collaborative—the person struggling was invited to help plan.

**Level 2** involves the family doing preparatory work without the person, but still with full transparency. The family might say: "We're continuing to meet with the interventionist. We're working on our own stuff and preparing to have a family meeting where we'll each share our concerns. We'd love for you to be part of this process."

**The Family's Work:**

During Level 2 meetings, families:
- Write impact letters (we'll cover this on Day 2)
- Identify enabling behaviors and make plans to stop them
- Work on their own recovery (Al-Anon, therapy, etc.)
- Build a united front while maintaining individual relationships
- Research treatment options
- Prepare for various outcomes

**The Strength-Based Focus:**

Even as families prepare to share concerns, Level 2 maintains a strength-based approach:
- Letters include expressions of love and hope
- The focus is on impact (how the person's behavior affects others) not judgment
- Natural consequences replace enabling
- The family offers help, not ultimatums

**When to Hold the Family Meeting:**

You'll hold the Level 2 family meeting when:
- The family is prepared (letters written, responses planned, treatment arranged)
- The person is experiencing natural consequences of their behavior
- The family has built enough strength to follow through
- You've maximized motivation without maximizing harm

## Level 3: Traditional Intervention (10 minutes)

**When You Move to Level 3:**

If Levels 1 and 2 haven't resulted in treatment engagement, Level 3 looks more like traditional intervention:
- More structured format
- Stronger boundaries and consequences
- More directive facilitation
- Greater emphasis on immediate treatment entry

**What's Still Different:**

Even at Level 3, values-based ARISE maintains:
- Dignity for the person struggling
- Respect for autonomy (they can still say no)
- Authenticity in communication
- Family responsibility for their own healing

**The Bottom Line Conversation:**

Level 3 might include clearer boundaries from family members:
- "If you don't get treatment, I can't continue to financially support you."
- "If you keep using, you can't live here anymore."
- "I love you, but I can't watch you die. I'm stepping back until you're ready for help."

These aren't manipulative ultimatums—they're healthy boundaries about what family members can and can't do.

**Important Reality:**

Even at Level 3, some people will say no. Values-based intervention acknowledges:
- We can't control anyone's choices
- Forcing someone into treatment rarely works long-term
- The family can heal even if the person doesn't enter treatment immediately
- Planting seeds matters even when we don't see immediate harvest

**The Continuum in Practice:**

Most families move through these levels over days or weeks, not months. The average ARISE process takes 4-7 days from first call to treatment entry. But the exact timing depends on:
- The person's readiness
- The family's capacity
- The severity of the situation
- Available treatment resources
