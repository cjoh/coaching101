# Session 1.3: Your Story & Motivations (90 minutes)

## Purpose

This session invites deep self-reflection about why you're drawn to intervention work and how your own story influences your practice. Self-awareness is the foundation of ethical, effective intervention work.

## Personal Story Exercise (40 minutes)

**Why This Matters:**

Your story is both your greatest asset and your greatest liability in this work. It gives you compassion, understanding, and credibility. It also creates blind spots, triggers, and the risk of making situations about you rather than the people you're serving.

The most effective interventionists know their story well enough to use it wisely and recognize when it's getting in the way.

**The Exercise:**

You'll have 30 minutes to write responses to these prompts. This is private—you won't be required to share anything you're not comfortable sharing, though you'll have opportunities to share if you choose.

**Prompts:**

**1. Your Recovery Journey:**
- What brought you into recovery? (This might be your own addiction, loving someone with addiction, growing up affected by addiction, or working in the field)
- What were the turning points?
- Who showed up for you? How?
- Who wasn't there when you needed them?
- What do you wish had been different?

**2. Your "Why":**
- Why do you want to do intervention work specifically?
- What do you hope to offer others that you received (or didn't receive)?
- What would it mean to you to help a family through an intervention?
- What needs of your own might this work fulfill?

**3. Your Vulnerabilities:**
- What aspects of intervention work might trigger your own pain?
- What types of people or situations might be especially challenging for you?
- What do you need to be aware of about yourself?
- What might cause you to lose objectivity?

**4. Your Strengths:**
- What wisdom have you gained from your experiences?
- What do you understand about struggle that someone without your history might not?
- What do you offer because of your journey, not in spite of it?

**Reflection Time:**

After writing, sit quietly with what came up. Notice:
- Which questions were easy to answer? Which were hard?
- What emotions arose as you wrote?
- What surprised you about your responses?
- What do you need to pay attention to as you move forward in this training?

## Partner Sharing (25 minutes)

**Purpose:**
Sharing your story with another person—even in brief form—helps you begin to distinguish between what's helpful to share in intervention work and what might be too much or inappropriately self-focused.

**How It Works:**

**Round 1 (10 minutes):** Partner A shares a 4-5 minute version of their story, focusing on:
- What brought them to this work
- One key insight from their own experience
- One concern they have about doing this work

Partner B listens without interruption, advice-giving, or sharing their own story. Just witness.

**Round 2 (10 minutes):** Switch roles. Partner B shares, Partner A listens.

**Debrief Together (5 minutes):**
- What was it like to share?
- What was it like to just listen?
- What did you notice about how you told your story?

**What to Notice:**

As you shared, were you:
- Speaking from a healed place or an open wound?
- Focused on connection or seeking validation?
- Offering hope or dwelling in pain?
- Clear about boundaries or blurring lines?

There's no judgment in these observations—they're just information about where you are and what you might need to address before doing this work professionally.

## Large Group Discussion (25 minutes)

**Sharing with the Group:**

Anyone who wants to can share one insight from their writing or partner conversation. Remember: You're not required to share details of your story. You can share the insight without the story behind it.

**Examples:**
- "I realized I want to do this work partly to get a different outcome than I got with my sister. That's something I need to watch."
- "I saw how much anger I still carry about how my family handled my addiction. I need to work through that before I can help other families."
- "I recognized that my experience gives me patience for people who aren't ready—because I wasn't ready for years."

**The Facilitator's Role:**

The facilitator will help the group notice patterns and themes:
- How personal experience can be both wisdom and blind spot
- The importance of ongoing personal work
- The distinction between sharing as connection vs. sharing as therapy
- The value of knowing your triggers before encountering them with clients

**Key Themes to Explore:**

**1. The "Savior Complex"**

Many people drawn to helping professions are motivated by a desire to rescue others—often from situations they couldn't fix in their own lives. This isn't inherently bad, but it becomes problematic when:
- You measure your worth by whether people change
- You work harder than the person you're helping
- You can't let people experience consequences of their choices
- You feel personally responsible for outcomes you can't control

**Question:** How will you distinguish between healthy helping and rescuing?

**2. Vicarious Healing**

Sometimes we enter helping fields hoping that helping others will heal us. Again, not inherently wrong—often true. But problematic when:
- You haven't done your own healing work first
- You use clients' stories to process your own trauma
- You need the work more than the people you're serving need you

**Question:** What healing do you need to do outside of your client work?

**3. The Authenticity Balance**

We talked about authenticity as a core value. But there's a difference between:
- Authentic presence (bringing your full, genuine self to the work)
- Self-disclosure (sharing details of your story)

You can be authentic without sharing your story. You can share your story without being authentic.

**Question:** How will you know when sharing your story serves the client vs. serves your need to be understood?

**4. Projection & Transference**

You will encounter people who remind you of:
- Yourself at your worst
- Your parent/child/sibling/friend who struggled
- The person you couldn't save
- The person who didn't save you

When you notice this happening, it's essential to:
- Name it (at least to yourself)
- Get supervision or consultation
- Consider whether you're the right person for this case
- Do your own therapy/healing work around it

**Question:** What will you do when you notice you're reacting to your own history more than the situation in front of you?

**The Practice of Self-Awareness:**

Self-awareness in this work means:

**Before you start:**
- Do your own recovery work
- Address your trauma
- Get therapy if needed
- Understand your motivations

**As you work:**
- Notice when you're triggered
- Recognize when you're working too hard
- Monitor your emotional responses
- Seek supervision regularly

**After challenging situations:**
- Debrief with colleagues
- Process your reactions
- Recommit to your own self-care
- Remember you can't pour from an empty cup

**Closing Reflection:**
- What do you need to address in your own healing before you're ready to do this work?
- Who in your life can help you stay self-aware?
- What will be your first sign that you're getting off track?
