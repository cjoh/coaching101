# Session 1.5: Reflection & Integration (45 minutes)

## Purpose

This closing session allows you to process what you've learned, identify remaining questions, and prepare for Day 2. Integration time is essential—without it, information doesn't become wisdom.

## Personal Reflection (20 minutes)

**Quiet Reflection Time:**

Find a comfortable spot (you can stay in the room or find a quiet space nearby). Spend 20 minutes with these prompts:

**1. What stands out?**
- What from today's sessions surprised you?
- What confirmed something you already knew?
- What challenged your assumptions about intervention work?

**2. What's shifting?**
- How has your understanding of intervention changed today?
- What are you thinking about differently than you were this morning?
- What questions are emerging?

**3. What do you need?**
- What do you need to learn more about?
- What personal work is this bringing up for you?
- What support would help you engage more fully tomorrow?

**4. What are you carrying?**
- What emotions came up today?
- What old memories or experiences are present?
- What do you need to acknowledge or release before tomorrow?

**Journaling Prompts:**

If writing helps you process, consider these deeper prompts:

*On your story:*
"The part of my story that will most help me in this work is..."
"The part of my story I need to be most careful about is..."

*On the role:*
"What excites me most about intervention work is..."
"What scares me most about intervention work is..."

*On the training:*
"So far, this training is meeting my needs by..."
"I wish this training would also address..."

*On readiness:*
"I feel ready to..."
"I don't yet feel ready to..."
"To be ready, I need..."

## Small Group Processing (15 minutes)

**Purpose:**
Hearing how others are processing the material helps you integrate your own learning and builds community within the training group.

**Format:**

Groups of 3-4 people. Each person has 3-4 minutes to share one thing from their reflection time. Others listen without interrupting.

**Possible Sharing Prompts:**
- One insight that's sticking with you
- One question you're sitting with
- One way your thinking has shifted today
- One thing you're looking forward to (or nervous about) tomorrow

**Guidelines:**
- You don't have to share anything too personal
- No crosstalk or advice-giving
- If someone shares something vulnerable, a simple "thank you for sharing that" is enough
- Notice what you have in common with others

## Closing Circle (10 minutes)

**Returning to the Large Group:**

The facilitator invites everyone back to the circle. This is a brief check-out, not a full debrief.

**Popcorn Style Sharing:**

Anyone who wants to can offer:
- One word describing how you're feeling right now
- One phrase capturing your biggest takeaway
- One hope for tomorrow

**Examples:**
- "Grateful"
- "Overwhelmed but good overwhelmed"
- "I'm noticing my own enabling patterns"
- "Hopeful that there's a gentler way to do interventions"
- "Aware of how much personal work I still need to do"

**The Facilitator's Role:**

The facilitator will:
- Acknowledge the emotional weight of Day 1
- Normalize whatever people are feeling
- Preview Day 2 briefly
- Remind everyone of self-care
- Express confidence in the group's capacity

**Logistics & Homework:**

**For tonight:**
- Rest. This is deep work.
- If things came up that need attention, reach out to your support system
- Review the Day 1 schedule and your notes if it helps you integrate
- Don't worry about preparing anything—just come back tomorrow ready to learn

**Tomorrow (Day 2) preview:**
We'll shift from awareness to structure. You'll learn:
- The ARISE method in detail
- How to conduct first calls
- How to facilitate family meetings
- Impact letter writing
- Treatment planning and placement

**Closing Words:**

"Today was about building the foundation—understanding the role, understanding yourself, understanding the values that guide this work. Everything we do tomorrow and the next day will rest on what you learned today. Thank you for showing up, for being honest, for staying open even when it was uncomfortable. Rest well. See you tomorrow."
