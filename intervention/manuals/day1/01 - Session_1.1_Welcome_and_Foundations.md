# Session 1.1: Welcome & Foundations (60 minutes)

## Purpose

This opening session establishes psychological safety, builds connection among participants, and introduces the Core Values framework that will guide the entire training. The way you begin this journey sets the tone for three days of deep learning and personal growth.

## Opening Circle (20 minutes)

**What This Is:**
The Opening Circle creates a container for authentic learning. Unlike traditional introductions that focus on credentials or achievements, this circle invites you to show up as a whole person—with your hopes, hesitations, and humanity intact.

**How It Works:**
- Sit in a circle where everyone can see everyone else
- The facilitator begins with a brief land acknowledgment and intention-setting
- Each person shares their name, their pathway to this training, and one hope they hold for these three days
- No crosstalk, advice-giving, or commentary—just witnessing and receiving

**What You Might Notice:**
- Nervousness about speaking in front of strangers
- Relief at hearing others express similar hopes or concerns
- The power of being heard without interruption or judgment
- A shift in the room's energy as people begin to relax

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What did you notice in your body as you prepared to speak?
- What surprised you about what others shared?
- What does it mean to you to be witnessed without commentary?

## Training Overview (15 minutes)

**The Three-Day Arc:**

**Day 1 (Awareness)** lays the groundwork. You'll examine who you are, why you're here, and what intervention actually entails. This is about building self-knowledge before you can effectively serve others.

**Day 2 (Structure)** introduces the ARISE method and practical intervention tools. You'll learn evidence-based approaches while remaining grounded in values-driven practice.

**Day 3 (Practice)** brings everything together through simulation, role-play, and integration. You'll practice facilitating interventions in a safe environment before doing so in the real world.

**Why This Sequence Matters:**
You cannot guide others through transformation you haven't navigated yourself. This training follows the same principle we'll apply in intervention work: awareness before action, self-knowledge before service, values before techniques.

## Core Values Framework Introduction (25 minutes)

**The Foundation:**
The Core Values framework recognizes that lasting change happens when people align their actions with their deepest values. This isn't about imposing external rules or following prescribed steps—it's about helping people discover what matters most to them and building their lives around those truths.

**Four Core Values:**

**1. DIGNITY**
- What it means: Every person has inherent worth that cannot be diminished by their circumstances, choices, or struggles
- In practice: We treat everyone—including ourselves—with respect, regardless of where they are in their journey
- The challenge: Can you maintain dignity for someone whose behavior you find troubling?

**2. AUTONOMY**
- What it means: People have the right to make their own decisions, even ones we disagree with
- In practice: We offer information and support, but we don't control outcomes or manipulate decisions
- The challenge: Can you hold space for someone's choices while still expressing care and concern?

**3. AUTHENTICITY**
- What it means: Being genuinely ourselves rather than performing a role or hiding behind a professional mask
- In practice: We share our own struggles appropriately, acknowledge our limitations, and show up as real humans
- The challenge: Can you be professional without being artificial?

**4. RESPONSIBILITY**
- What it means: Owning our choices, their consequences, and our impact on others
- In practice: We model accountability, acknowledge mistakes, and maintain clear boundaries
- The challenge: Can you take responsibility for your role without taking responsibility for others' choices?

**How These Values Guide Intervention Work:**

In traditional intervention models, success is often measured by whether someone immediately accepts treatment. In values-based intervention, success is measured by whether we honored dignity, respected autonomy, showed up authentically, and took responsibility for our role—regardless of the immediate outcome.

This doesn't mean we're passive or that outcomes don't matter. It means we trust that when we create the right conditions—when we honor these four values—people are more likely to move toward change that lasts.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- Which of these four values feels most natural to you?
- Which one challenges you most?
- How have you experienced (or not experienced) these values in your own recovery journey?
- How might these values change the way you approach difficult conversations?

## Questions & Clarifications

**Common Questions:**

*"Isn't intervention about getting someone into treatment? How can we respect autonomy if that's the goal?"*

The goal isn't to force someone into treatment—it's to create conditions where they can make an informed choice about their own life. We respect autonomy by being honest about our concerns, sharing accurate information, and then stepping back to let them decide. Sometimes that means they say no. Our job is to make sure they have the chance to say yes.

*"What if someone's choices are putting others at risk?"*

Respecting autonomy doesn't mean ignoring harm. We can honor someone's agency while still setting boundaries about what we will and won't participate in. We can advocate for safety while acknowledging we can't control another person's behavior.

*"How do I stay authentic without making it all about my story?"*

Authenticity in intervention work means being genuinely present and human, not performing perfection. It means admitting when you don't know something, sharing relevant experiences when appropriate, and letting your care show. But it's always in service of the person you're supporting—not a therapy session for you.
