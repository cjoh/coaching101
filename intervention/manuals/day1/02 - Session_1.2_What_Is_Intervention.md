# Session 1.2: What Is Intervention? (75 minutes)

## Purpose

This session defines intervention work and distinguishes it from other helping roles. Understanding what intervention is—and what it isn't—protects both you and the people you serve.

## Defining Intervention (20 minutes)

**The Basic Definition:**
An intervention is a structured conversation where people who care about someone communicate their concerns about that person's substance use or behavior, with the goal of motivating change.

**But That's Not the Whole Story:**

Traditional intervention models often focused on "breaking through denial" or leveraging consequences to force someone into treatment. Values-based intervention takes a different approach:

- **It's not about confrontation**—it's about connection
- **It's not about breaking someone down**—it's about building them up while being honest
- **It's not about control**—it's about creating conditions for choice
- **It's not about winning**—it's about caring enough to show up

**Key Elements:**

**1. Preparation:** Extensive work happens before the actual intervention meeting—assessing readiness, coordinating participants, researching treatment options, planning logistics.

**2. Structured Communication:** The intervention meeting follows a format that balances emotional expression with clear requests and next steps.

**3. Immediate Action:** If the person agrees to treatment, we're ready to act immediately—transportation arranged, admission confirmed, bags packed.

**4. Follow-Through:** The work doesn't end when someone enters treatment. Intervention includes supporting the family system through the transition and addressing what happens after the person leaves.

**What Makes Intervention Unique:**

- **Time-sensitivity:** Often working with people in crisis or at critical decision points
- **Family system involvement:** Not just supporting one person but navigating complex family dynamics
- **High stakes:** Decisions made in intervention can have life-or-death consequences
- **Resistance:** Unlike coaching where people seek help, intervention often involves people who haven't asked for our involvement
- **Logistics:** Coordinating treatment placement, insurance, transportation, timing

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What was your initial understanding of intervention before this training?
- How does values-based intervention differ from what you've seen portrayed in media?
- What aspects of intervention work feel exciting? What feels scary?

## Activity: Intervention vs. Other Roles (30 minutes)

**Purpose:**
This activity clarifies the boundaries between intervention and other helping roles. Understanding these distinctions protects you from scope creep and helps you know when to refer to other professionals.

**The Four Roles:**

**INTERVENTIONIST:**
- Focus: Facilitating structured conversations to motivate change, usually around substance use
- Timeframe: Short-term, crisis-oriented (days to weeks)
- Who initiates: Usually family/loved ones, not the person struggling
- Relationship: Professional, time-limited
- Training: Specialized in assessment, family systems, treatment placement, crisis management
- Example: "I'm going to help your family prepare for and facilitate a conversation about their concerns regarding your drinking"

**THERAPIST/COUNSELOR:**
- Focus: Treating mental health conditions, processing trauma, building coping skills
- Timeframe: Ongoing (months to years)
- Who initiates: The client themselves
- Relationship: Therapeutic alliance with clear clinical boundaries
- Training: Licensed mental health professional (LCSW, LPC, psychologist, psychiatrist)
- Example: "Let's explore the underlying factors contributing to your anxiety and develop strategies for managing it"

**RECOVERY COACH:**
- Focus: Supporting someone in building and maintaining recovery, developing life skills
- Timeframe: Medium to long-term (months to years)
- Who initiates: The person in recovery
- Relationship: Supportive, sometimes peer-based, more flexible than therapy
- Training: Peer recovery specialist certification or recovery coach training
- Example: "I'll walk alongside you as you build a life you don't want to escape from"

**SPONSOR:**
- Focus: Guiding someone through 12-step work within a mutual aid fellowship
- Relationship: Peer-based, spiritual companionship within recovery community
- Timeframe: Ongoing, as long as it serves both people
- Who initiates: The sponsee asks the sponsor
- Training: Lived experience in 12-step recovery, working the steps themselves
- Example: "Let's work through the fourth step together so you can experience the freedom it brings"

**Activity Instructions:**

You'll receive cards describing different scenarios. Working in small groups, identify:
1. Which role is most appropriate for each scenario
2. What red flags might indicate scope issues
3. When you might need to refer to another professional

**Scenarios for Discussion:**

*Scenario 1:* A family calls you because their 28-year-old son's drinking has escalated. He lost his job, his wife left, and he's now living in their basement. He denies there's a problem. They want help.
- **Primary role:** Interventionist
- **Why:** Family-initiated, person hasn't sought help, focused on substance use, crisis point
- **Potential referrals:** Therapist (for family members dealing with trauma), treatment center (for the son if he agrees)

*Scenario 2:* Someone who completed treatment three months ago calls you. They're struggling with anxiety about social situations and considering drinking again to cope. They want ongoing support building sober coping skills.
- **Primary role:** Recovery coach or therapist
- **Why:** Person-initiated, focused on ongoing recovery support and skill-building, not acute crisis
- **Not intervention because:** They're already in recovery and seeking help themselves

*Scenario 3:* A woman you worked with through intervention six months ago calls. She completed treatment and has been sober since. She wants help processing childhood trauma she's starting to remember now that she's not drinking.
- **Primary role:** Therapist
- **Why:** Requires clinical training in trauma treatment, beyond scope of intervention or coaching
- **Your role:** Support her in finding an appropriate trauma therapist, celebrate her courage in addressing this

*Scenario 4:* A man asks you to be his sponsor. You facilitated an intervention that got him into treatment, and he trusts you. You're both in 12-step recovery.
- **Primary role:** This is a boundary question
- **Why it's complicated:** The professional intervention relationship may make it difficult to transition to the peer-based sponsor relationship
- **Considerations:** Power dynamics, dual relationships, whether you can shift roles cleanly

**Debrief Questions:**
- What did you notice about the differences between these roles?
- Where do you see potential for boundary confusion?
- Have you ever experienced receiving help from someone in the wrong role? What was that like?
- What will you do when someone asks you for help that's outside your scope?

**The Boundary Principle:**

Clear boundaries aren't about being rigid or unhelpful—they're about ensuring people get the right kind of help from the right person. Saying "that's not my role, but let me help you find someone who can help with that" is one of the most caring things you can do.

## Group Discussion: Ethics & Boundaries (25 minutes)

**The Foundation:**

Ethics in intervention work isn't about following a rulebook—it's about holding yourself accountable to the values you claim to serve. When we prioritize dignity, autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility, ethical decisions become clearer (though not always easier).

**Key Ethical Principles:**

**1. Do No Harm**
- Consider the full impact of your involvement, not just the immediate goal
- Recognize that harm can come from action or inaction
- Question: "Could my involvement make things worse?"

**2. Informed Consent**
- Everyone participating in an intervention should understand what they're agreeing to
- People have the right to say no at any point
- Question: "Does this person understand what's happening and what I'm asking of them?"

**3. Confidentiality with Exceptions**
- What's shared with you is generally confidential
- Exceptions: Imminent danger to self or others, child abuse, elder abuse, court orders
- Question: "Have I clearly explained the limits of confidentiality?"

**4. Cultural Humility**
- Your approach may not fit everyone's cultural context
- Recovery looks different across cultures and communities
- Question: "Am I imposing my cultural assumptions on this family?"

**5. Self-Awareness**
- Know your triggers, limitations, and biases
- Recognize when your own story is interfering with your work
- Question: "Is this about them or about me?"

**Common Ethical Dilemmas:**

*Dilemma 1: The Desperate Family*

A family is willing to lie to get someone to the intervention meeting. "Just tell him we're going to brunch," they say. "Once he's there, he won't leave."

**The tension:** They're desperate and their loved one is in danger. But deception violates autonomy and authenticity.

**Questions to consider:**
- How might starting with deception affect the entire intervention?
- What message does it send about trust and honesty?
- Are there ways to increase the likelihood of attendance without lying?
- What if the person is in immediate danger?

**Possible approach:** "I understand your desperation, and I want to help. But I've learned that interventions built on deception often backfire. Let's talk about honest ways to invite him that respect his dignity while still expressing urgency."

*Dilemma 2: The Grateful Client*

After a successful intervention, the family wants to keep paying you for weekly "check-ins" that are starting to feel like ongoing therapy. You care about them and want to help, but this isn't what you're trained for.

**The tension:** They trust you and you've helped them. But scope creep puts everyone at risk.

**Questions to consider:**
- What harm could come from continuing beyond your scope?
- What's driving your desire to keep working with them?
- How can you support their ongoing needs without providing services you're not qualified for?

**Possible approach:** "I care about your family, and I want you to get the ongoing support you need. What you're describing sounds like family therapy, which is outside my role as an interventionist. Let me help you find a great therapist who can provide what you need."

*Dilemma 3: The Personal Connection*

You're asked to facilitate an intervention for someone who reminds you intensely of your own brother who died from an overdose. You find yourself feeling desperate to save this person.

**The tension:** Your personal experience gives you compassion and understanding. But it might also cloud your judgment.

**Questions to consider:**
- Can you maintain professional objectivity?
- Are you trying to get a different outcome with this person than you got with your brother?
- How will you manage your emotional responses?
- Is it fair to this person to work with them when you're carrying this history?

**Possible approach:** Consult with a supervisor or colleague. Be honest about the parallel. Consider referring to another interventionist if you can't separate your own grief from this person's situation.

**Discussion Prompts:**
- Which ethical principle feels most challenging to you?
- Have you witnessed ethical violations in recovery or helping settings? What was the impact?
- How will you know when you're outside your scope?
- What support systems do you need to help you navigate ethical dilemmas?

**The Practice of Ethics:**

Ethics isn't something you learn once and check off a list. It's an ongoing practice of:
- Pausing before acting
- Consulting with others when uncertain
- Prioritizing the person's wellbeing over your own ego or agenda
- Being willing to say "I don't know" or "I need help with this"
- Returning again and again to the core values that guide your work
