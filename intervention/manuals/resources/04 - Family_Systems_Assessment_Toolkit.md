# Section 3: Family Systems Assessment Toolkit

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

Effective interventions require a layered understanding of the family system. Use these factors and prompts during intake, ongoing case reviews, and supervision.

## Key Assessment Factors

1. **Safety**
   - Screen for immediate risks: overdose history, suicidal behaviors, violence, weapon access.
   - Identify who will activate emergency services and under what triggers.
2. **Urgency**
   - Determine crisis status versus planned engagement; map timelines for treatment availability.
   - Clarify financial, legal, or medical deadlines influencing decisions.
3. **Readiness**
   - Gauge the Pivot Person's awareness and willingness using MI conversations and collateral reports.
   - Assess family readinessâ€”are they prepared to change their own behaviors?
4. **Relational Capacity**
   - Map alliances, fractures, and communication patterns.
   - Note who soothes conflict, who escalates, and who withdraws.

## Dynamics to Observe

- **Enabling Patterns:** Who protects the status quo? What needs keep them in that role?
- **Roles & Narratives:** Who is the historian, the rescuer, the scapegoat? How do these roles shift under stress?
- **Communication Styles:** Do they rely on indirect hints, heated arguments, or silence? What new scripts could be introduced?
- **Cultural Context:** Identify traditions, spiritual frameworks, and community expectations that influence help-seeking.
- **Family Strengths:** Document resilience, humor, shared values, and prior moments of successful collaboration.

## Assessment Workflow

1. **Pre-Intake Preparation:** Review referral notes, align on safety thresholds, and prepare culturally informed questions.
2. **Initial Interviews:** Conduct individual conversations before hosting group dialogues; record consent for information-sharing.
3. **Case Mapping Session:** Build a visual or narrative map of the system (use the Family System Mapping Template) and highlight leverage points.
4. **Action Planning:** Translate insights into healthy choice agreements and intervention mode selection.
5. **Supervision Review:** Present findings to your mentor within 72 hours to validate assumptions and address blind spots.
