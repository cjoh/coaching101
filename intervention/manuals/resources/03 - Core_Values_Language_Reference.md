# Section 2: Core Values Language Reference

**Version 1.0 | Core Values Recovery**

---

Language shapes perception. The Core Values lexicon reduces stigma, reinforces partnership, and keeps dignity centered.

## Key Terms and Practice Notes

| Preferred Language | Use When | Avoid | Why It Matters | Practice Prompt |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Pivot Person | Referring to the individual at the center of the intervention | Labels like "addict," "alcoholic," "IP" | Highlights agency and central role without stigma | "When I speak with the Pivot Person, I will name their strengths before making requests." |
| Healthy Choices | Coaching families on boundary-setting | "Boundaries" framed as punishment | Emphasizes proactive care instead of defensive detachment | "What healthy choice do you want to make when the Pivot Person declines help?" |
| Person with substance use disorder | Discussing clinical status or history | Diagnostic shorthand that reduces personhood | Reinforces person-first language, aligns with ethical standards | "Describe the person, not the problem. What values are they trying to live by?" |
| Recovery is a team sport | Opening or closing family meetings | Messaging that isolates or blames the Pivot Person | Shifts focus to systemic healing and shared responsibility | "List the team members supporting recovery this week and their next action." |

## Facilitator Practices

- Begin every meeting by modeling the preferred language; invite the family to correct each other gently when old habits surface.
- Capture quotes highlight the new language in session notes to reinforce culture change.
- When documents from other providers use stigmatizing terms, translate them before sharing with the family to maintain alignment.
