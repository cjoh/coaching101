INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Core Values Coaching

What Is This? 
Welcome to your journey to become a Core Values Coach! This guide will equip you with the knowledge and skills to support individuals in their recovery and personal growth. Mastering the concepts and techniques presented here will elevate your coaching abilities and profoundly impact your clients' lives.

Who Can Be A Core Values Coach
Good core values coaches:
Tend to seek recovery themselves. They are well-versed in the language of recovery and participate in some form of support group.
Tend to have been sober for over a year.
Tend to be good listeners and good question-askers.
Have already trained in some form of coaching — either executive/life coaching, family coaching or recovery coaching. 
Are honest and open-minded and willing to make this curriculum their own.
Can see the distinction between commitment to values and attachment to outcome.

Who Can Benefit from Core Values Coaching?
Core Values Coaching is a versatile approach that can be tailored to a wide range of clients, including:
Individuals who have recently completed treatment and are embarking on their early recovery journey
Those who seek additional support to complement their 12-step program
Clients who have been in recovery for an extended period and desire continued growth and development 
As a Core Values Coach, you will have the flexibility to work with a diverse clientele, adapting your approach to meet their unique needs and circumstances. 
The other beneficiary of Core Values coaching is you! Taking others through the journey will further your growth and personal insight. That’s why every certified coach of Core Values Coaching has been through the program themselves. 
There are clients for whom Core Values Coaching does not work. Clients in the middle of trauma, clients who are still experiencing the crisis of very early recovery and are struggling with engaging their frontal cortex, and clients who are still in active addiction struggle to get value from this framework. For those clients, the coach may find purpose in being a safe place for the client to vent while they complete the very early stages of recovery and build enough cognitive capacity to turn to this work. 

What Happens in Core Values Coaching?
Core Values Coaching is a 10-module program to guide clients from early to long-term sobriety. The program may be delivered online or in person and is intended for one-on-one sessions. It is designed to be delivered in a minimum of 12 sessions that incorporate both client-led and planned sessions, covering key areas such as:

Discovering Core Values: Clients self-reflect to identify their deepest beliefs and learn to align their actions with these values.
Understanding Inner Voices: Clients develop the ability to recognize and effectively manage the various "voices" within their minds.
Building Habits: Clients establish healthy routines and practices that support long-term recovery and overall well-being.
Overcoming Blocks: Clients identify and address the obstacles hindering their progress, developing strategies to overcome these challenges.
Practicing Acceptance: Clients cultivate the skill of accepting reality as it is, leading to reduced stress and increased inner peace.
Increasing Awareness: Clients enhance their self-awareness and mindfulness, fostering a deeper understanding of themselves and their environment.
Creating a Vision and Goals: Clients articulate a clear vision for their future and set achievable goals to bring that vision to life.

Through your guidance and support, clients will learn to:
Prioritize their values over temporary comfort or instant gratification
Develop habits that align with their long-term goals and aspirations
Cultivate self-acceptance and self-understanding
Reduce the impact of negative emotions while amplifying positive ones

As you embark on this training, take a moment to reflect on your challenges, strengths, and aspirations. Consider how embodying your core values has influenced your life and how you can leverage your experiences to inspire and guide others. Your path to becoming a Core Values Coach begins with internalizing and modeling the principles you will impart to your clients.






ETHICS
The heart of core values coaching




Why We Lead with Ethics
Ethics are the foundation of Core Values Coaching. You can’t have values without ethics. If we want to help our clients connect with their values, we must lay a solid foundation upon which that connection can rest, and that foundation must be built with ethics. Focusing on ethics from the start shows that we don't just talk about values but live by them. It ensures that how we act as coaches matches the honesty and realness we want to teach our clients. Being ethical in coaching is more than just following rules; it's about living the values we believe in.

Admitting that we can hurt others is a severe but necessary part of ethical coaching. The relationship between a coach and client is naturally unbalanced regarding power and influence, especially in the early phases of recovery, where this program is mainly applied. Ethical coaching protects against this imbalance causing harm, whether through misusing power, crossing boundaries, or misunderstanding roles. It's a promise not to hurt anyone, putting the client's well-being, independence, and growth first.

Our Code of Ethics:

As a Core Values Coach, I Will
Accurately identify my qualifications, expertise, and certifications to all I serve and the public.
Conduct myself by this Code of Ethics.
Remain free from any substances that affect my ability to perform my duties as a Core Values Coach.
Honor my client’s time by making my work with them about them, not about me.
Recognize personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that may impact my performance as a Core Values Coach.
Maintain connections with other coaches so that I can address personal issues, behaviors, or conditions that negatively affect my recovery.
Respect and acknowledge the professional efforts and contributions of others.
Maintain documentation for all client records.
Protect the privacy and confidentiality of all clients.
I will immediately disclose any perceived conflict of interest to my client and to another coach and make an outbound referral if necessary.
Disclose any pre-existing professional, social, or business relationships that may affect my client. 
Terminate the relationship when it ceases to be helpful to the client.
Refer the client out to a relevant therapist and cease coaching when necessary.
Keep and maintain appropriate, culturally sensitive boundaries with everyone I serve.
Not engage in sexual or personal relationships with any client or client family members.

Knowing our roles: Coaches, Therapists, and Sponsors



Therapists bring a clinical view to healing, dealing with trauma and mental illness with professional knowledge. They often focus on healing past hurts and looking at the client's history to find and fix the causes of current problems. This relationship has professional boundaries, with therapists staying distant to give objective, therapeutic support. Therapy is a space for exploring and healing, where clients are encouraged to lead their recovery journey.

Sponsors guide their sponsees through the 12 steps with care and understanding. They act as mentors, sharing their recovery journeys to light the way for others. Their role is hands-on, giving real-time support and being someone to talk to about day-to-day challenges. The sponsor-client relationship is marked by being available and sharing experiences, creating a special bond based on everyday struggles and successes.

Core Values Coaches support the client's future self, encouraging them to imagine and work towards their best version. This role looks to the future, focusing on creating a vision and setting goals to reach it. Coaches challenge clients to step out of their comfort zones, recognizing and dealing with the voice of addiction that may hold them back. By sharing personal stories when appropriate, coaches give practical insights and accountability, helping clients find and use the support and resources they need to succeed.

We Core Values Coaches must adhere to strict boundaries and “know our lane” when working with clients. We should work to support and encourage our clients to have good relationships with both their sponsors and therapists and we should usually help our clients follow their guidance. Coaches will want to create positive relationships with their therapists and work as a team to support their clients' recovery. But before doing so, we must seek permission from our clients to disclose our relationships with their therapist. We do so by getting a formal Release of Information (ROI) signed by our client and their therapist so that everyone knows the disclosure and the confidentiality. 

The boundary between a coach and a sponsor is essential to keep the coaching relationship strong. While a Core Values Coach may personally take part in 12-step programs, their professional role is separate. Direct involvement in the client's 12-step journey, like going to 12-step meetings together, is kept to a minimum to ensure the coach stays an objective, supportive figure focused on the client's overall recovery journey and to create space for the client to establish connections in the 12-step rooms. Often, when a coach is present, a client may have difficulty finding a sponsor, as it’s assumed that the coach is the sponsor. The coach should always follow the sponsor's lead regarding the client's 12-step work. This separation ensures that the unique benefits of both sponsorship and coaching are kept, giving full support for the person's recovery.

It’s also worth noting that the coach may not disclose their relationship to anyone, even in a 12-step room. While the client may disclose that their coach is their coach, it is inappropriate for the coach to disclose that relationship as it is a breach of confidentiality. It is best to bring clients into meetings to help them walk through the door and then get out of the way so you are not mistaken for a sponsor. 

The boundary between a coach and a therapist is also vital. A therapist generally works from the present and into the past. They help heal past trauma, process emotional reactions, and help pull apart and understand conflict. A core values coach works from the present and into the future. We set goals and create visions for the future. We help challenge assumptions and interpretations of events, but we don’t spend much time trying to fix or heal our clients — we aren't usually the ones who handle that. If we do, we must encourage our client to work with their therapist or make a therapeutic referral. 

Therapists also diagnose people with words like “depression,” “PTSD,” “codependency,” and even “addiction.” Core values coaches tend to shy away from these words, other than helping clients put a name to feelings and encouraging them to seek therapeutic resources to investigate further. Coaches focus on helping clients build a positive future rather than diagnosing issues from the past. We empower clients to create their own solutions, offering guidance and support without trying to "fix" them. If deeper emotional work is needed, we refer to therapists who are trained to handle those situations.

By staying in our lane and respecting professional boundaries, Core Values Coaches create a safe space for growth and self-discovery, complementing the important work of therapists and sponsors.

As Core Values Coaches, we expect the sponsors and therapists working with our clients to be ethical. If we spot unethical behavior, we guide our clients to the appropriate resources to handle the situation. We can often use the moment to teach our clients about values while empowering them to make their own choices. We do not often rescue our clients but provide them with the resources to rescue themselves. When in doubt about what to do, we seek the guidance of other coaches.






Session cadence
For core values coaching



The fundamentals of a good coach will always have you following a certain session cadence.  This is particularly important in your open and closing sessions.  If it is a session that has planned context such as one of the core values coaching modules then still follow these steps and confirm that you will be working on the “module name” evoking agreement from your client without leading them.

Establish the coaching agreement
Clarify the session topic and desired outcome
Confirm what success looks like today (through specific measures)
Explore current reality
Ask open-ended, empowering questions
Reflect on emotions, patterns, and tone (active listening)
Deepen awareness without judgment
Evoke new awareness
Challenge assumptions with curiosity
Use the power of pause (silence), metaphors, and reflection (mirror back)
Connect insights with the client’s life as you understand it today
Establish accountability and wrap up
Confirm follow-through goals and support needs for execution
Start to close the session with learning awareness, “What did you learn about yourself today?”
Close the session with affirmation and alignment 



Essential skills
For core values coaching



80% of coaching are these tools

Acknowledging and validating
Acknowledging and validating are essential coaching skills. Acknowledging involves recognizing the client’s experiences, emotions, and efforts without judgment, while validating means affirming the client’s feelings as understandable and real. These practices build trust, deepen rapport, and create psychological safety, allowing clients to explore more openly and authentically. Acknowledgment and validation are not about agreement—they’re about being fully present and honoring the client’s truth in the moment.

Empowering Open ended questions
Empowering open-ended questions are a cornerstone of effective coaching, as they invite clients to explore their inner world, core values, and potential without judgment or leading. These questions spark reflection, deepen self-awareness, and help clients uncover insights that drive meaningful action. By focusing on possibility rather than limitation, empowering questions support autonomy and growth, allowing clients to access their own wisdom and take ownership of their journey.  (See Sample Open Ended. Questions Handout)

Obtaining buy-in
Obtaining buy-in in coaching means creating a collaborative agreement where the client feels personally invested in the coaching process and aligned with the goals being pursued. It involves ensuring the client understands the purpose of the work, sees the relevance to their values and vision, and genuinely chooses to engage with the process. True buy-in leads to greater commitment, accountability, and openness, as the client takes ownership of their growth rather than feeling pushed or externally directed.

Sharing Personal Stories
Sharing personal stories or experiences with a client can strengthen the coaching relationship if done thoughtfully and with consent. The main reason for doing this is to create a deeper connection and trust, showing clients that their feelings and experiences are understood and shared. But it requires good judgment. Coaches must always ask themselves why they want to share a particular story and get clear permission from the client before doing so. This approach respects the client's independence and models vulnerability, demonstrating that openness and honesty are valued and safe in the coaching space.

why share your story
To build trust in safety
To model vulnerability
To help the client feel less isolated
To create credibility
To reframe failure and mistakes
To give language to a hard to name experience.

Risks of Sharing Personal Stories
While there are benefits to sharing personal stories, coaches must be careful to avoid some risks:
The risk of making the session about the coach: Sharing personal stories should never take the focus away from the client. Coaches should consider why they want to share a personal story and how it helps the client's journey and goals.
Possible damage to the professional boundary: Inappropriate or too much sharing of personal stories can blur the lines of the professional relationship, making it hard to keep an objective and supportive coaching environment. This is especially important when an interpretation of romantic advance can be interpreted. 
Stepping into the sponsor's role: In recovery coaching, it's important to respect the sponsors' special support role in the 12-step framework. Coaches should avoid entering areas usually handled by sponsor guidance to maintain the integrity and complementary nature of both supports.

how share your story
The purpose of sharing your story in core values coaching is never to impress, explain or educate. It's deliberate to open space for the clients new own emergence, insight, and empowerment.
See How To Share Your Story Handout In Appendix

Other Options Besides Directly Sharing Personal Stories
Use general stories: Sharing experiences in a general way can provide insight and guidance without personal details, keeping a professional distance while still offering valuable lessons.
Use “a friend”: Make the story about a friend or “another person you worked with” rather than about you.. 

Focus on the client: Instead of telling personal stories, coaches can direct questions and reflections back to the client, helping the client explore and understand themselves more deeply.

Letting the Clients Find Their Solutions
Good Core Values Coaches tend to let their clients solve their own problems rather than solve problems for them. When we solve problems for our clients, we take away their chance to struggle, learn from their values, and grow. Instead, we support our clients through their problems. Problem-solving can show up in a few different ways:

Giving advice: There’s a difference between giving advice and sharing our experience. Giving advice means telling clients what they should do, while sharing experience offers insights without telling them what to do. Coaches should aim to share their experiences in a way that empowers clients to make their own choices. You are giving advice when you use phrases like "You need to," "If I were you, I would," or "You should just."

Rescuing: When clients face challenges, jumping in and rescuing them can be tempting. We cannot rob our clients of the experience of suffering because on the other side of suffering is growth.  Coaches should support clients through difficulties but not protect them from the growth that comes from overcoming obstacles. You are rescuing when you are doing things for your clients that they can do for themselves, such as making phone calls, setting up appointments, fixing problems with loved ones or family members, or giving financial help.

Prescribing specific actions to solve problems: Coaches may be tempted to provide solutions when clients share problems. However, this approach can create dependence and limit the client's ability to develop problem-solving skills. Instead, coaches should ask open-ended questions, guiding clients to explore their own solutions. This empowers clients to trust their own judgment and build confidence in their ability to handle challenges. Coaches foster growth, strength, and self-belief by supporting clients through problem-solving. You prescribe when you tell your client exactly what they need to do to solve a problem without your client's agreement.

By avoiding giving advice, rescuing, and prescribing, coaches create a space for clients to develop their own problem-solving abilities. This approach encourages independence, self-trust, and resilience, giving clients the tools to handle challenges long after the coaching relationship has ended.

Our Bias
In a typical coaching relationship, we follow our clients without hesitation wherever they go. We let the client lead and meet them where they are, and when we have a bias, we usually try to name it and then set it aside. However, in a Core Values Coaching relationship, the coach is hired to help the client achieve greater recovery from something.

This thing could be drugs, alcohol, grief, a toxic relationship, or something else. That means that Core Values Coaches have a disclosed, built-in and agreed-upon bias. A bias against that behavior and possibly towards a new behavior. We can't help our clients stay in recovery from alcohol if we have a neutral position towards drinking.

We can't help our clients overcome toxic relationships if we don't help them see abusive or codependent behavior as bad. This bias is not only acceptable but necessary for effective Core Values Coaching. It is important to be clear about this bias from the beginning and ensure that clients understand and agree to work within this framework. Coaches can provide consistent, focused support throughout the journey by maintaining a clear stance against the behavior or issue the client seeks to recover from.

In the introduction of the client workbook, the client is asked to name their "focus" — the thing they want to recover from. This focus becomes the foundation for the coaching relationship, ensuring that the coach and client work together to support recovery.
Coaches can provide consistent, targeted guidance and support by maintaining a clear stance in favor of the client's recovery goals. This approach helps clients stay motivated, accountable, and committed to their recovery journey, even when faced with challenges or setbacks. Coaches must balance maintaining their bias toward recovery while creating a non-judgmental and supportive environment for their clients.



Session Management - How to run this program
How the Program Works
Core Values Coaching is a 10-module coaching program designed to be delivered online or in person and is intended for one-on-one sessions. It is designed to be delivered in a minimum of 12 sessions. Each module can be used independently, but the modules are designed to flow together and build off each other. Once the Core Values and Committee Thinking modules are completed, it is up to the coach to help the client choose what the next module should be based on what the coach has learned in the previous sessions.  The two Open Sessions and the Closing Session are based off of the same format and are used to dive deeper into a module such as Blocks which can often take 2-3 sessions to complete or a current life subject the client would like to prioritize.

The 12+ Session program typically flows like this:
The First Session
Core Values
Committee Thinking
Habits
Blocks
Open Session
Awareness 
Acceptance
Open Session
Vision
Goals
Closing Session

The system is designed to take the client through a journey of learning new skills (sessions 1-5), introspection (sessions 6-8), and forward-thinking (Sessions 9-12). You, the coach, lead the client through the curriculum. By the end, the client should be leading most of the session. By the end of the program, your client should know what it feels like to have open sessions (traditional executive coaching sessions) with you and have a year's worth of goals to achieve. From that list, you may continue to engage with them to help them achieve those goals.

It is possible to move through this program more slowly. For those in the earliest stages of recovery, consider spending 3-4 sessions just allowing the client to vent, clear their mind, and stabilize before engaging in homework, as they may not be able to engage with the work. 

Alternatively, you can space this series across 22 sessions by putting an open session between each workload. Trust your instincts and trust your client. Core Values Recovery believes you know your client.

Session Outline
For the most part, each session should follow a general pattern:

Spend 5-10 minutes catching up on the week if needed and use as an opportunity to listen for a potential session topic other than the assigned homework.  If a new topic appears to be more important then there are four bases to cover:
What’s the topic?
Why is it important?
How will we know we’re successful at the end of our session?
What do we need to address to get there?
If nothing then Spend the next 10-20 minutes reviewing last week’s assignment.
Spend 20 minutes in inquiry/scenario discussion about the tools learned. 
In the last 10 minutes of the session, introduce the client to the next assignment and ask if they have any feedback or questions.
Follow up with the client via email with notes from the session, reflections, and the next session’s homework.

These are guidelines, not rules. You know your client and should trust your instincts about how best to handle each individual. You and your client may format this program however you choose.
