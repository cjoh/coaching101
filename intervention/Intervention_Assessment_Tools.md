- During training exercises (Day 2, Session 2.3)
- For case discussions and supervision

---

### **STEP 1: SAFETY/URGENCY ASSESSMENT** (Score 0-10)

**Question**: How immediate is the danger to the Pivot Person or others?

#### **Scoring Guide**:

**0-2: MINIMAL URGENCY**
- No current substance use OR very low-level use
- No health complications
- No legal issues

- **Indicators**: Maintenance phase, family wanting to prevent relapse

---

**3-4: LOW URGENCY**
- Occasional use, some consequences mounting
- Minor health concerns (sleep issues, anxiety)
- Job performance declining slightly
- Relationships strained but communicating
- **Indicators**: Early-stage problem, family wanting to intervene before escalation

---

**5-6: MODERATE URGENCY**
- Regular use, pattern established
- Health issues developing (weight loss/gain, elevated liver enzymes, high blood pressure)
- Job warnings, attendance problems
- Relationships seriously strained, arguments frequent
- Minor legal issues (DUI, possession charge)

**Safety/Urgency Score**: _____ / 10

---

### **STEP 2: READINESS LEVEL ASSESSMENT** (Stages of Change)

**Question**: Where is the Pivot Person on the Stages of Change continuum?

#### **Stages of Change Framework** (Prochaska & DiClemente):

**☐ PRECONTEMPLATION** (Unaware / In Denial)
- "I don't have a problem"
- Cannot see impact of using on self or others
- Hostile or defensive when topic raised
- Blames others for consequences
- No intention to change "I'm fine"
- May be coerced by others to attend meetings/treatment but doesn't believe change is needed

**Signs**:
- Minimizes consequences
- Rationalizes using
- Refuses to discuss it
- Gets angry when family brings it up

**Typical Intervention Modes for Precontemplation**: Mode 2 (Structured Invitation), Mode 3 (Planned Surprise), Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc Crisis)

---

**☐ CONTEMPLATION** (Ambivalent / Weighing Options)
- "Maybe I have a problem, but I'm not sure"
- Sees some negative consequences
- Weighing pros and cons of using
- Considering change but not committed
- May say "I'll think about it" or "Maybe someday"
- Acknowledges concern from others but not ready to act

**Signs**:
- Admits there's a problem (sometimes)
- Talks about wanting to change "eventually"
- Asks questions about treatment
- Expresses fear or uncertainty

**Typical Intervention Modes for Contemplation**: Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation), Mode 2 (Structured Invitation), Mode 5 (Individual MI-based)

---

**☐ PREPARATION** (Planning Change / Ready Soon)
- "I need to do something, and I'm thinking about when/how"
- Actively researching options (treatment centers, meetings, therapists)
- Told family "I'm going to get help"
- Small steps taken (thrown out paraphernalia, attended one meeting, called treatment center)
- Intends to take action within next 30 days
- May have set a "quit date"

**Signs**:
- Asks specific questions about HOW to get help
- Researches treatment online
- Tells loved ones about plans
- Attends meetings exploratively

**Typical Intervention Modes for Preparation**: Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation), Mode 5 (Individual) - minimal intervention needed, more coordination

---

**☐ ACTION** (Actively Changing / In Early Recovery)
- Currently in treatment or recently completed
- Attending meetings regularly
- Working with therapist/coach/sponsor
- Abstinent (or significantly reduced use)
- Making visible behavior changes

**Intervention Note**: If someone is in ACTION stage, formal intervention typically not needed. May need:
- Family coaching (to support recovery)
- Relapse prevention planning
- Continued coordination of care team

---

**☐ MAINTENANCE** (Sustaining Change / Long-term Recovery)
- Sober for 6+ months
- Established recovery routine
- Working a program (12-step, therapy, coaching)
- Relapse prevention skills in place
- Life rebuilding (relationships, work, meaning)

**Intervention Note**: Maintenance typically doesn't require intervention unless relapse occurs.

---

**Readiness Level**: ☐ Precontemplation  ☐ Contemplation  ☐ Preparation  ☐ Action  ☐ Maintenance

---

### **STEP 3: RELATIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT** (Score 0-10)

**Question**: How strong are the family relationships and communication patterns?

#### **Scoring Guide**:

**0-2: SEVERELY FRACTURED**
- No communication OR only hostile/abusive communication
- History of violence (physical, emotional, verbal abuse)
- Family members refuse to be in room together
- Complete estrangement (no contact for years)
- Deep, unhealed trauma (abuse, betrayal, abandonment)
- Active restraining orders or legal separation
- **Indicators**: Family system too damaged for group intervention

**Relational Capacity 0-2 → Likely Mode 5 (Individual) or crisis services needed first**

---

**3-4: FRACTURED**
- Communication extremely difficult (yelling, blaming, shutting down)
- High conflict, frequent explosive arguments
- Trust severely damaged
- Family members may participate BUT with significant hostility
- Resentments deep and verbalized openly
- Threats made ("I'm done with you")
- **Indicators**: Family needs preparation, may require individual sessions first before group

**Relational Capacity 3-4 → Mode 3 (Planned Surprise), Mode 5 (Individual), or extensive family prep needed**

---

**5-6: STRAINED BUT INTACT**
- Communication difficult but possible (arguments happen but people eventually talk)
- Trust damaged but not destroyed
- Family willing to work together despite conflict
- Resentments present but family still cares
- Ability to sit in room together (even if uncomfortable)
- History of resolving problems together (in the past, before addiction escalated)
- **Indicators**: Family system stressed but functional, capable of intervention with support

**Relational Capacity 5-6 → Mode 2 (Structured Invitation), Mode 3 (with preparation), Mode 5 (if family unavailable for group)**

---

**7-8: FUNCTIONAL WITH STRAIN**
- Communication open about some topics, difficult about addiction
- Some trust remains (family believes Pivot Person loves them)
- Family can problem-solve together (when not about addiction)
- Conflict managed (disagreements don't escalate to explosions)
- Love expressed (even if through frustration: "I'm angry because I care")
- Willingness to learn new communication patterns
- **Indicators**: Good foundation for collaborative intervention

**Relational Capacity 7-8 → Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation), Mode 2 (Structured Invitation)**

---

**9-10: STRONG, TRUSTING**

- Trust intact (despite addiction strain)
- History of successfully navigating crises together
- Mutual respect present
- Love clearly and regularly expressed
- Family sees themselves as a team
- Ability to set healthy choices without punishment
- **Indicators**: Ideal for collaborative, transparent intervention

**Relational Capacity 9-10 → Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation) strongly recommended**
