## üìñ CORE VALUES RECOVERY PHILOSOPHY

### What Is an Intervention?
An intervention is a **guided process of connection** ‚Äì bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move away from crisis and toward recovery. It is an adaptable process of **awareness, coordination, and care** that creates the conditions where recovery can begin and stay.

**The outcome of intervention is connection, honesty, and hope.**

### What Is Recovery?
Recovery is a **lifelong process** of reclaiming your connection to your values, meaning, and purpose ‚Äì usually from a loss caused by addiction.

### What Makes Core Values Different

‚úÖ **Intervention IS recovery** ‚Äî Recovery is lifelong, not a one-time event

‚úÖ **No formula** ‚Äî Every family requires a personalized path

‚úÖ **Invitation over coercion** ‚Äî Dignity and respect, not shame

‚úÖ **Recovery is a team sport** ‚Äî Success requires coordinated care:
- Professional intervention from a certified interventionist
- Intensive treatment (minimum 90 days)
- Regular peer-based meetings (12-step, SMART Recovery, etc.)
- Sober living / IOP / PHP
- Licensed therapy
- Certified peer support
- Family support from certified family coach
- Accountability and monitoring

‚úÖ **No financial conflicts** ‚Äî Interventionists assess and recommend resources without financial interest in outcomes

‚úÖ **Collaborative professionals** ‚Äî Providers share information, understand roles, know where their work ends and another's begins

‚úÖ **Whole system recovery** ‚Äî The lifelong process of recovery belongs to the entire network/family, not just the Pivot Person

---

## ü™û FACILITATOR STANCE: "GUIDE NOT GURU"

### Your Role as Facilitator

You are **NOT** here to:
- ‚ùå Be the expert with all the answers
- ‚ùå Lecture at participants
- ‚ùå Tell them the "right way" to intervene
- ‚ùå Perform your expertise

You **ARE** here to:
- ‚úÖ Hold space for experiential learning
- ‚úÖ Model reflective listening and presence
- ‚úÖ Facilitate discovery through powerful questions
- ‚úÖ Create psychological safety for vulnerable sharing
- ‚úÖ Guide participants to their own wisdom

**Teaching Method**: 70% experiential activities, 30% didactic content

---

## üå≥ THE THREE PILLARS OF INTERVENTION

Every session, activity, and concept in this training rests on three pillars:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ AWARENESS
- Recognizing addiction as a disease affecting the whole system
- Understanding family roles, enabling patterns, and denial
- Becoming aware of one's own limits, triggers, and biases
- Seeing the Pivot Person's humanity separate from their behavior

**Day 1 Focus**: Building awareness in families and participants

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ COORDINATION
- Mobilizing the network (family, friends, professionals)
- Clear role boundaries (interventionist vs. coach vs. therapist vs. sponsor)
- Communication strategies and documentation practices
- Creating coordinated care plans without financial conflicts of interest

**Day 2 Focus**: Teaching the architecture of care coordination

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ CARE
- Expressing care through action, not just words
- Maintaining dignity even in structured interventions
- Following through with long-term support (40-week mentorship)
- Self-care for the interventionist (avoiding burnout, vicarious trauma)

**Day 3 Focus**: Practicing care in real scenarios

---

## üîë CORE VALUES OF AN INTERVENTION

As you facilitate this training, continuously reinforce these core values:

ü§ù **Dignity, respect, and invitation** over coercion and control

üîó **Connection** as both process and outcome

üåê **"The recovery belongs to the whole system"** ‚Äî systems theory in practice

‚öñÔ∏è **The three pillars**: Awareness, Coordination, and Care

üíé **Core Values lens**: Working from integrity, humility, and service

---

## üë• PROFESSIONAL DISTINCTIONS (Critical Teaching)

Participants MUST understand these role boundaries:

### **Peer Coach**
- Works **FOR the Pivot Person**
- Meets them where they are
- Helps stay connected to growth, accountability, community
- Focuses on present and future

### **Interventionist**
- Works **FOR the family/network**
- Translates family needs into pathways for change
- Advocates for recovery of both individual AND system
- Coordinates care across providers
- Time-limited (crisis ‚Üí stabilization ‚Üí handoff)

### **Family Coach**
- Works **FOR the family members**
- Helps family stay in their own recovery
- Focuses on boundaries, communication, values-based living
- Long-term support (often 52 weeks)

### **Therapist**
- Clinical treatment, diagnosis, trauma processing
- Works from present into the past
- Licensed professional with specific scope of practice

### **Sponsor**
- 12-step mentorship, working the steps
- Peer relationship based on lived experience
- Informal, ongoing, community-based

---

## üó£Ô∏è LANGUAGE MATTERS

### Core Values Language Choices

**"Pivot Person"** (not "person of concern" or "addict")
- Why: Acknowledges that the individual's struggle creates a pivot point for the WHOLE family system to turn toward growth
- Emphasizes shared responsibility and movement, not blame

**"Healthy Choices"** (not "boundaries")
- Why: Places ownership and empowerment with the person making the choice
- Focuses on self-leadership rather than controlling others
- Language of agency, not reaction

**"Recovery is a Team Sport"** (not "family disease")
- Why: Emphasizes collaboration and shared effort
- Positions recovery as active and collective

**"Invitation over Coercion"** (not "tough love")
- Why: Centers dignity and respect
- Allows for structure when necessary but never loses humanity

## üåü THE INTERVENTION CONTINUUM (Core Innovation)

**This is THE signature contribution of Core Values Interventionist Training.**

Traditional intervention training teaches ONE model (usually Johnson confrontation or ARISE invitation). Core Values teaches a **spectrum approach** based on real-world assessment of:
- **Safety/Urgency** (medical crisis vs. stable functioning)
- **Readiness Level** (Stages of Change)
- **Relational Capacity** (trust, communication, family cohesion)
- **Historical Pattern** (previous attempts, treatment dropout)

### The 5 Intervention Modes:

1. **Collaborative Invitation** (Most invitational)
   *Based on ARISE, CRAFT ‚Äî Pivot Person invited from the start*

2. **Structured Invitation** (Invitational with planning)
   *Based on LoveFirst, Storti ‚Äî Prepared meeting with dignity*

3. **Planned Surprise** (Structured non-invitational)
   *Modified Johnson with Core Values dignity ‚Äî structure with grace*

4. **Ad-Hoc Intervention** (Crisis-responsive)
   *Emergency model ‚Äî rapid coordination*

5. **Individual Intervention** (One-on-one)
   *MI-based ‚Äî building trust and readiness*

**See full module**: `Intervention_Continuum_Module.md`

**Teaching Day**: Day 2, Session 2.3 (11:15 AM - 12:30 PM)

- **Emotional disclosure**: Acknowledge, validate, offer break, check in privately
- **Disagreement with material**: "That's a valid perspective. What's your experience?"

---

## üß† LEARNING THEORY FOUNDATIONS

This training is grounded in three evidence-based frameworks:

### 1. **Adult Learning (Andragogy) ‚Äî Malcolm Knowles**
- Self-directed: Participants are internally motivated
- Experience-based: Lived experience is the primary teaching resource
- Goal-oriented: Connect learning to specific, practical objectives
- Respect: Honor participants' wisdom

**Application**: Facilitate, don't lecture. Ask, don't tell.

### 2. **Experiential Learning Cycle ‚Äî David Kolb**
Every module follows four stages:
1. **Concrete Experience** ‚Üí Do the activity
2. **Reflective Observation** ‚Üí Reflect on what happened
3. **Abstract Conceptualization** ‚Üí Connect to broader concepts
4. **Active Experimentation** ‚Üí Apply learning to new situations

**Application**: Never skip reflection. That's where deep learning happens.

### 3. **Trauma-Informed Facilitation ‚Äî SAMHSA Principles**
- **Safety**: Physical and emotional safety through structure
- **Trustworthiness**: Transparent about what will happen and why
- **Choice**: Offer options for participation
- **Collaboration**: Co-create learning experiences
- **Empowerment**: Emphasize strengths and capacity

**Application**: Debrief using TiPS framework (Orientation ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Catharsis ‚Üí Psychoeducation ‚Üí Recovery)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS & RESPONSE PROTOCOLS

### **During Training, Watch For:**

üö® **Participant becomes tearful or visibly distressed**
- **Response**: Acknowledge with respect, offer break, private check-in

üö® **Participant discloses active suicidal ideation or plan**
- **Response**: Immediate private conversation, connect to crisis line, do NOT continue until safety assessed

üö® **Participant exhibits signs of intoxication**
- **Response**: Private conversation, ask to leave if necessary, follow up with supervisor

üö® **Participant discloses harm to self or others**
- **Response**: Document, mandatory reporting if required by law, connect to resources

## üôè CLOSING THOUGHTS

**Dear Facilitator,**

You are holding space for one of the most sacred and challenging roles in recovery: **guiding families through crisis toward connection.**

Intervention work is not for the faint of heart. It requires clinical knowledge, ethical clarity, emotional regulation, and deep humility. The participants in front of you are stepping into work that will test them, transform them, and demand their very best.

Your job is not to make them experts in three days. Your job is to:
- **Awaken their awareness** of systems, language, and self
- **Equip them with tools** for coordination and collaboration
- **Model the care** they will need to sustain for decades

Remember: **You are a guide, not a guru.**

Trust the process. Trust the participants. Trust the Core Values framework.

And when in doubt, return to the three pillars:

**Awareness. Coordination. Care.**

With gratitude for your service,

**The Core Values Recovery Team**
