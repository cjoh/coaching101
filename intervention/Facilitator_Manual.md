## OVERVIEW & PHILOSOPHY

### Purpose of Coaching 101

**Coaching 101: Core Values Foundations for Recovery Coaches** is a three-day, 21-hour introductory training that introduces the mindset, skills, and ethics of peer recovery coaching through the Core Values Recovery framework.

This training serves as a bridge between standard state Peer Support Specialist curricula (≈40 hours) and CCAR Recovery Coach Academy (30 hours + 16 hours Ethics), with a distinctive emphasis on experiential learning and values-driven practice.

### The "Guide Not Guru" Stance

🪞 **Core Principle: Coach as Mirror**

At the heart of this training is the fundamental distinction between being a "guide" and being a "guru":

- **Guru approach:** Directive, advice-giving, solution-providing, expert-centered
- **Guide approach:** Reflective, question-asking, presence-holding, person-centered

Recovery coaches serve as mirrors, helping individuals see their own wisdom, strength, and capacity for growth. We do not tell people what to do—we help them discover what they already know.

### Core Values Recovery Framework

This training is built upon the Core Values Recovery philosophy, which emphasizes:

- **Values over Comfort:** Making decisions based on core values rather than immediate comfort
- **Reflection over Prescription:** Mirroring insights rather than providing answers
- **Presence over Performance:** Being fully present rather than performing expertise
- **Questions over Advice:** Asking powerful questions rather than giving advice
- **Boundaries over Rescue:** Maintaining professional limits rather than crossing into rescuing

### Positioning & Alignment

**How This Training Fits:**

- **State Certification Pathways:** Serves as foundational preparation for Utah CPSS (40h), Ohio PRS (40h), and Texas PRSS (46h) certifications
- **CCAR Alignment:** Complements CCAR Recovery Coach Academy (30h) with deeper experiential practice
- **Experiential Focus:** 70% experiential activities, 30% didactic content
- **Values-Based:** Every module connects back to Core Values framework

---

## TRAINING DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Adult Learning (Andragogy)

This training is grounded in Malcolm Knowles' principles of adult learning:

1. **Self-Directed:** Adults are internally motivated; avoid imposing information
2. **Experience-Based:** Draw on participants' lived experiences as teaching resources
3. **Goal-Oriented:** Connect learning to specific, practical objectives
4. **Practical Focus:** Emphasize real-world application and problem-solving
5. **Respect:** Honor participants' wisdom and provide strong voice in discussions

**Application:** Facilitate, don't lecture. Ask, don't tell. Elicit, don't impose.

### Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb)

Every module follows David Kolb's four-stage learning cycle:

1. **Concrete Experience** → Engage in activity (roleplay, exercise, case study)
2. **Reflective Observation** → Reflect on what happened (journaling, paired sharing, group debrief)
3. **Abstract Conceptualization** → Connect to broader concepts (link to Core Values framework, coaching theory)
4. **Active Experimentation** → Apply learning to new situations (action planning, next steps)

**Facilitation Note:** Never skip the reflection and conceptualization phases. This is where deep learning happens.

### Trauma-Informed Facilitation

**Core Principles:**

- **Safety:** Create physical and emotional safety through clear structure, predictability, and choice
- **Trustworthiness:** Be transparent about what will happen and why
- **Choice:** Offer options for participation (e.g., "Share if you're comfortable")
- **Collaboration:** Co-create learning experiences rather than imposing them
- **Empowerment:** Emphasize strengths and capacity for growth

**Debrief Protocol (TiPS Framework):**

1. **Orientation:** Set up the debrief with clear purpose and structure
2. **Review:** What happened during the activity?
3. **Catharsis:** How did it feel? What emotions came up?
4. **Psychoeducation:** What does this teach us about coaching/recovery?
5. **Recovery:** How will you apply this learning? What support do you need?

**Red Flags During Training:**

- Participant becomes tearful or visibly distressed
- Participant discloses active suicidal ideation or plan
- Participant exhibits signs of intoxication
- Participant discloses harm to self or others

**Response Protocol:**

1. Acknowledge the participant's experience with respect
2. Offer a break and private check-in
3. Connect to appropriate resources (crisis line, EAP, therapist)
4. Document incident and follow up with supervisor

**9:00-9:10 — Welcome & Introductions (10 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]

*Stand in a welcoming posture, make eye contact with participants as they arrive.*

"Good morning, and welcome to Coaching 101: Core Values Foundations for Recovery Coaches. My name is [your name], and I'm honored to be your guide for these next three days.

Before we begin, I want to acknowledge something important: many of you are here because you have lived experience with recovery—whether from substance use, mental health challenges, or other life struggles. That lived experience is not a deficit; it's your greatest asset as a peer coach.

This training is different from what you might expect. We're not here to turn you into experts or therapists. We're here to help you become skilled guides—people who can hold space, ask powerful questions, and reflect back the wisdom that's already within the people you'll serve.

Over the next three days, we'll be doing a lot of experiential learning—which means we'll be practicing, roleplaying, and reflecting together. This requires trust, vulnerability, and respect. I'll be modeling these qualities, and I invite you to do the same.

Let's begin by going around the room. Please share:
1. Your first name
2. One word that describes why you're here today

I'll start: My name is [your name], and my word is 'service.'"

*Go around the circle. Listen actively. Reflect back any themes you notice.*

---

**9:10-9:30 — Values Cards Circle (20 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS]

**Purpose:** Connect participants to their core values and create initial bonding through shared reflection.

**Setup:**
- Place one Core Values Cards deck in the center of each table (4-6 people per table)
- Ensure cards are face-up and visible to all

**Instructions to Participants:**

"Now we're going to do an activity called the Values Cards Circle. You'll notice there's a deck of Core Values Cards in the center of your table. These cards represent different values that guide us in recovery and in life—things like honesty, courage, compassion, growth, and service.

Here's how it works:

1. Take a moment to look through the cards silently. You're looking for one card that represents a core value that's calling to you today—something that feels alive for you right now.

2. Once everyone has selected a card, we'll go around the circle. Share your name, your card, and a brief story about why this value matters to you today. Keep it to about one minute each.

3. As others share, practice listening with your full presence. Notice what resonates.

You have two minutes to choose your card. Begin."

*Facilitate the sharing circle. Model deep listening. Offer reflections if appropriate.*

**Debrief Questions:**
- "What did you notice as people shared?"
- "Were there any common themes?"
- "How did it feel to be listened to?"

---

**9:30-9:40 — Shared Agreements (10 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Group Agreements]

"Before we dive into content, let's co-create some shared agreements for our time together. These are the norms that will help us create a safe, respectful, and productive learning space.

I'll start with a few suggestions, and then I invite you to add your own:

- **Confidentiality:** What's shared here stays here (unless there's a safety concern)
- **Respect:** Honor each person's story and perspective
- **Right to pass:** You can always choose not to share
- **One mic:** One person speaks at a time
- **Assume positive intent:** Give each other grace

What else would you like to add?"

*Write suggestions on flip chart. Post in visible location for all three days.*

---

**9:40-9:45 — Overview & Logistics (5 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Logistics]

"Here's what to expect over the next three days:

**Day 1:** We'll explore the foundations—what is a recovery coach, how is it different from other helping roles, and what is the Core Values framework?

**Day 2:** We'll build skills—communication, ethics, boundaries, and documentation.

**Day 3:** We'll practice—you'll have the chance to do actual coaching conversations and prepare for your next steps toward certification.

**Logistics:**
- Lunch break: 12:15-1:15 PM (one hour)
- Morning break: 15 minutes around 10:45 AM
- Afternoon break: 15 minutes around 2:45 PM
- Bathrooms are [location]
- Please silence phones during sessions

Any questions before we continue?"

**10:00-10:20 — Core Values Philosophy (20 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Core Values]

"Now let's talk about the Core Values framework that we'll be using throughout this training. This isn't just a recovery framework—it's a way of being, a lens for making decisions, and a guide for how we show up as coaches.

The Core Values Recovery framework is built on this central question:

**'What decision can I make right now that honors my deepest values, even if it's uncomfortable?'**

Let me explain through metaphors:

🪞 **Coach as Mirror:** We reflect back what we see and hear, helping people discover their own wisdom. We don't tell people what to do—we help them see what they already know.

🧭 **Values as Compass:** When people are lost, confused, or in crisis, their values serve as a compass pointing them toward their true north. We help them reconnect to that compass.

🗼 **Lighthouse, Not Lifeboat:** We provide guidance and illumination, but we don't rescue. We hold the light steady so people can navigate their own way to shore.

🌳 **Roots and Growth:** Recovery is both grounding in core values (roots) and continuous growth (branches reaching upward).

Now, let's talk about the core tension we navigate:

**Values vs. Comfort**

- Comfort-based decisions ask: 'What will make me feel better right now?'
- Values-based decisions ask: 'What aligns with who I want to be?'

As recovery coaches, we help people navigate this tension. We don't judge comfort-based choices, but we help people see the pattern and explore alternatives.

**Discussion Question:** Turn to a partner and discuss: 'Can you think of a time when you made a values-based decision even though it was uncomfortable? What was that like?'"

*Allow 5 minutes for paired discussion. Invite 2-3 volunteers to share insights with large group.*

**Break: 10:45-11:00 AM (15 min)**

---

### SESSION 1.3: Role of the Recovery Coach (11:00 AM-12:15 PM) — 75 min

**Learning Objective:** Clearly differentiate peer coaching from therapy, clinical counseling, sponsorship, and other helping roles

**Materials Needed:**
- Flip chart with three columns: "Therapist," "Sponsor," "Recovery Coach"
- Handout: "Comparison of Helping Roles"
- Participant workbook (pages 8-12)

**Session Flow:**

| Time | Activity | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| 11:00-11:15 | What Recovery Coaches Do (and Don't Do) | Interactive presentation |
| 11:15-11:45 | Comparison Activity | Small group work |
| 11:45-12:00 | Scope of Practice Scenarios | Case study discussion |
| 12:00-12:15 | Integration & Questions | Large group Q&A |

**11:00-11:15 — What Recovery Coaches Do (and Don't Do) (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Role Clarity]

"Let's get very clear about what a recovery coach is—and what a recovery coach is NOT.

**What Recovery Coaches DO:**

✅ **Listen actively** and reflect back what you hear
✅ **Ask powerful questions** that help people explore their own thinking
✅ **Hold space** for people to process emotions and experiences
✅ **Share lived experience** (when appropriate and with clear boundaries)
✅ **Help identify values, goals, and action steps**
✅ **Connect people to resources** and support systems
✅ **Provide hope** through your own recovery journey
✅ **Walk alongside** people on their recovery path
✅ **Model healthy boundaries** and self-care

**What Recovery Coaches DON'T DO:**

❌ **Diagnose** mental health or substance use disorders
❌ **Prescribe** medications or treatment plans
❌ **Provide therapy** or clinical counseling
❌ **Give advice** or tell people what to do
❌ **Sponsor** (as in 12-step sponsorship with step work)
❌ **Rescue** or solve people's problems for them
❌ **Become friends** or blur professional boundaries
❌ **Share personal contact information** for 24/7 availability
❌ **Work outside scope of practice** or training

This may feel frustrating at first—especially for those of you with strong instincts to help and fix. But remember: recovery coaches are guides, not gurus. Our power comes from what we DON'T do as much as what we do."

---

**11:15-11:45 — Comparison Activity (30 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Comparison Chart]

**Purpose:** Help participants clearly distinguish between different helping roles

**Setup:**
- Divide participants into three groups
- Assign each group one role: Therapist, Sponsor, Recovery Coach
- Provide flip chart paper and markers

**Instructions to Participants:**

"I'm going to divide you into three groups. Each group will be assigned a different helping role: therapist, sponsor, or recovery coach.

Your task is to create a poster that answers these questions about your assigned role:
1. What is the primary purpose of this role?
2. What training/credentials are required?
3. What are 3-5 key activities this person does?
4. What are the boundaries or limits of this role?
5. What does a typical relationship look like? (formal, informal, time-limited, ongoing, etc.)

You have 15 minutes to create your poster. Choose someone to present your findings to the full group."

*Circulate among groups. Offer guidance as needed.*

**11:30-11:45 — Gallery Walk & Presentations (15 min)**

Each group presents their poster (3 minutes each). After all presentations, facilitate discussion:

**Discussion Questions:**
- "What surprised you about these different roles?"
- "Where do you see the most overlap? Where are the clearest distinctions?"
- "Which role feels most aligned with your skills and calling?"
- "What concerns do you have about staying within scope as a recovery coach?"

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Recovery coaches occupy a unique space: professional but peer-based, structured but flexible
- All three roles are valuable; they're not in competition
- Knowing your limits is a strength, not a weakness
- When in doubt, consult your supervisor

---

**11:45-12:00 — Scope of Practice Scenarios (15 min)**

[FACILITATION ACTIVITY - Case Study Discussion]

"Now let's practice applying this knowledge to real-world situations. I'm going to read three brief scenarios. For each one, I want you to think about:
1. Is this within or outside the scope of a recovery coach?
2. What would you do in this situation?"

**Scenario 1: The Medication Question**

*"You're meeting with Marcus, who mentions he's been feeling depressed lately and asks if you think he should try antidepressants. What do you do?"*

**Correct Response:**
- Acknowledge his feelings without diagnosing
- Affirm that it's great he's noticing his mental health
- Suggest he talk to his doctor or therapist about medication options
- Offer to help him prepare questions for his medical provider
- Stay in your lane: "I'm not qualified to advise on medications, but I can support you in getting the professional help you need."

---

**Scenario 2: The 24/7 Request**

*"Jasmine is doing well in her recovery but says she's worried about cravings at night. She asks for your personal cell number so she can call you anytime. What do you do?"*

**Correct Response:**
- Validate her concern about cravings
- Explain professional boundaries: "I care about your recovery AND I need to maintain clear boundaries. I'm available during our scheduled sessions."
- Help her create a crisis plan: sponsor, crisis line, trusted friend, emergency services
- Connect her to 24/7 resources (crisis hotline, peer warmline, etc.)
- Role-model healthy boundaries

---

**Scenario 3: The Advice Request**

*"During a session, Devon says, 'You've been through this—what would YOU do if you were me? Should I break up with my girlfriend or try to make it work?' What do you do?"*

**Correct Response:**
- Resist the urge to give advice (even though you might have an opinion!)
- Reflect the question back: "It sounds like you're really torn about this decision."
- Ask powerful questions: "What do your values tell you?" "What would honor your recovery right now?" "What are the pros and cons you're weighing?"
- Help them explore their own wisdom rather than imposing yours
- Remember: Coach as mirror, not guru

---

**12:00-12:15 — Integration & Questions (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Q&A]

"Before we break for lunch, let's open it up for questions. What's still unclear about the role of a recovery coach? What concerns do you have?"

*Field questions openly. Acknowledge the complexity and gray areas.*

**Key Messages to Reinforce:**
- You don't have to have all the answers
- Supervision is your friend—use it
- When in doubt, consult. Don't guess.
- It's okay to say, "I don't know" or "That's outside my scope"

"Remember: recovery coaches are powerful BECAUSE of our clear boundaries, not in spite of them. Our humility is our strength."

---

**Lunch Break: 12:15-1:15 PM (60 min)**

---

### SESSION 1.4: Core Values Framework Deep Dive (1:15-2:30 PM) — 75 min

**Learning Objective:** Deeply understand and experientially practice the Values vs. Comfort framework

**Materials Needed:**
- Participant workbook (Values Chart, pages 14-17)
- Flip chart for "Scripts & Blocks"
- Handout: "Common Values in Recovery"

**Session Flow:**

| Time | Activity | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1:15-1:30 | Introduction to Values vs. Comfort | Interactive teaching |
| 1:30-2:00 | Values Clarification Exercise | Individual + paired work |
| 2:00-2:20 | Scripts & Blocks Concept | Group brainstorm |
| 2:20-2:30 | Integration & Commitment | Reflection |

---

**1:15-1:30 — Introduction to Values vs. Comfort (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Values vs. Comfort]

"Welcome back from lunch. This afternoon, we're going to go deep into the heart of the Core Values framework: the tension between COMFORT and VALUES.

Let me start with a story from my own recovery: [*Share a brief personal example of a time you chose values over comfort—e.g., making an amends, setting a boundary, asking for help when you wanted to isolate. Keep it under 2 minutes.*]

Here's the core idea:

**Every decision we make comes from one of two places:**

1. **Comfort:** What will make me feel better RIGHT NOW? What will reduce my anxiety, pain, or discomfort immediately?

2. **Values:** What will align with who I want to be? What honors my long-term well-being and integrity?

Neither is 'wrong,' but they often lead us in different directions.

**Examples:**

| Situation | Comfort-Based Choice | Values-Based Choice |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Conflict with friend | Avoid, ghost, say nothing | Have honest conversation |
| Feeling lonely | Call ex, engage in old behaviors | Call sponsor, go to meeting |
| Offered a drink at party | Say yes to fit in | Decline and leave if needed |
| Made a mistake at work | Hide it, hope no one notices | Own it, make it right |

As recovery coaches, we help people SEE this pattern in their decision-making. We don't judge the comfort-based choices—we understand them. We've all been there. But we help people explore: 'What might a values-based choice look like here?'

The question we always come back to is: **'What decision honors your values, even if it's uncomfortable?'**"

---

**1:30-2:00 — Values Clarification Exercise (30 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Values Chart]

**Purpose:** Help participants identify and prioritize their own core values

**Setup:**
- Direct participants to Values Chart in workbook (pages 14-15)
- Ensure everyone has a pen

**Instructions to Participants:**

"Turn to page 14 in your workbook. You'll see a list of common values—things like honesty, courage, compassion, growth, service, and many others.

**Step 1 (5 minutes):** Review the list and circle ALL the values that resonate with you—values that feel important to who you are or who you want to be.

**Step 2 (5 minutes):** Now, narrow it down. From your circled values, choose your TOP FIVE. These are your non-negotiables—the values you want to guide your life and your work as a recovery coach.

**Step 3 (10 minutes):** For each of your top five values, write a brief sentence about WHY this value matters to you. What life experience taught you this value? How does it show up in your recovery?

You'll have 20 minutes total. Work silently at first."

*Allow time for individual work. Soft background music optional.*

**1:50-2:00 — Paired Sharing (10 min)**

"Now, turn to a partner and share your top five values. Tell them WHY these values matter to you. Practice listening deeply—don't interrupt, don't fix, just witness."

*Facilitate paired sharing. Each person gets 4 minutes; signal when to switch.*

---

**2:00-2:20 — Scripts & Blocks Concept (20 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Scripts & Blocks]

"Now let's talk about what gets in the way of living our values. We call these SCRIPTS and BLOCKS.

**Scripts** are the old stories we tell ourselves—the automatic thoughts that keep us stuck:
- 'I'm not good enough'
- 'Nobody cares about me'
- 'I always mess things up'
- 'I don't deserve good things'
- 'People will leave me if they really know me'

**Blocks** are the behaviors and patterns we use to avoid discomfort:
- Isolation
- People-pleasing
- Perfectionism
- Control
- Dishonesty
- Blaming others

As recovery coaches, we help people identify their scripts and blocks WITHOUT JUDGMENT. We don't shame people for having them—we all have them. We help people SEE the pattern and explore alternatives.

Let's brainstorm together: What are some common scripts you've noticed in yourself or others?"

*Write participant responses on flip chart. Validate each one.*

"And what about blocks? What are the behaviors we use to protect ourselves from discomfort?"

*Capture responses. Make connections to addiction/recovery when appropriate.*

**Key Teaching Point:**

"Scripts and blocks are PROTECTION mechanisms. They served a purpose at some point—they helped us survive. We don't need to judge them or try to eliminate them instantly. We just need to NOTICE them. Awareness is the first step toward change."

---

**2:20-2:30 — Integration & Commitment (10 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing]

"As we close this session, I invite you to reflect on this question:

**'What is ONE script or block that you're becoming aware of? How might it impact your work as a recovery coach?'**

Write your response in your workbook. This is private—you won't be asked to share unless you choose to."

*Allow 5 minutes for journaling.*

"Remember: the work we do on ourselves is the foundation of the work we do with others. If we can't recognize our own scripts and blocks, we can't help others see theirs. Self-awareness is the coaching superpower."

---

**Break: 2:30-2:45 PM (15 min)**

---

### SESSION 1.5: Listening & Presence Skills (2:45-4:00 PM) — 75 min

---

**2:45-3:00 — Levels of Listening Framework (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Listening Levels]

"Welcome back. We're going to spend the next hour practicing the single most important skill in recovery coaching: LISTENING.

Most of us think we're good listeners. And you know what? In everyday life, we probably are. But coaching-level listening is different. It's deeper. It requires us to set aside our own agenda and be fully present with another person's experience.

Let me introduce you to the **Four Levels of Listening**:

**Level 1: Downloading**
- Listening for what we already know or expect to hear
- Waiting for our turn to talk
- Internally preparing our response while the other person speaks
- *Example:* Someone says, 'I'm struggling,' and we immediately think, 'Oh, I know exactly what they should do...'

**Level 2: Factual**
- Listening for data, information, and facts
- Paying attention to content but not emotion
- Focused on WHAT is being said, not HOW it's being said
- *Example:* Someone says, 'I relapsed last week,' and we ask, 'What substance? How much?'

**Level 3: Empathic**
- Listening for emotion, energy, and meaning
- Noticing body language, tone, and what's NOT being said
- Connecting to the person's experience, not just their words
- *Example:* Someone says, 'I'm fine,' but you sense shame or sadness beneath the words

**Level 4: Generative**
- Listening from possibility and potential
- Holding space for emergence—what wants to be born in this conversation
- Trusting the process, not forcing a direction
- *Example:* Being present with silence, allowing space for insight to emerge

**As recovery coaches, we aim for Level 3 and 4 listening.** This requires us to quiet our own inner noise—our judgments, our advice, our need to fix—and simply BE WITH the person.

The question we hold is: **'What is this person's experience right now, and how can I honor it?'**

Now let's practice."

**3:00-3:45 — Listening Triads Practice (45 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Listening Triads]

**Purpose:** Practice active listening with structured feedback

**Setup:**
- Divide participants into groups of three
- Assign roles: Speaker, Listener, Observer
- Set timer for three rounds of 12 minutes each (total 36 min)

**Instructions to Participants:**

"You're going to practice listening in groups of three. Each person will take a turn in three roles:

1. **Speaker:** Share a personal story about a time you made a values-based decision in your recovery. Speak for 4 minutes.

2. **Listener:** Your ONLY job is to listen with full presence. No interrupting, no fixing, no advice-giving. You can use minimal encouragers ('mm-hmm,' nodding) and reflective statements ('It sounds like...' or 'What I'm hearing is...'), but mostly, just listen.

3. **Observer:** Watch the interaction. Notice the listener's body language, eye contact, and presence. After the speaker finishes, you'll offer 2 minutes of feedback to the listener.

**Each round is 12 minutes:**
- 4 minutes: Speaker shares
- 4 minutes: Listener reflects back what they heard (Speaker, does this feel accurate?)
- 3 minutes: Observer offers feedback to Listener
- 1 minute: Quick reset before next round

We'll do three rounds so everyone gets to experience all three roles. Any questions?"

*Set timer and facilitate three rounds. Circulate and observe. Note powerful moments to highlight in debrief.*

---

**3:45-4:00 — Debrief & Integration (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Debrief]

"Come back to the full circle. Let's debrief this experience.

**For Speakers:** How did it feel to be deeply listened to? What did you notice?"

*Allow 3-4 responses.*

"**For Listeners:** What was challenging about this? What did you notice yourself wanting to do?"

*Allow 3-4 responses.*

"**For Observers:** What did you notice about effective listening? What made the difference?"

*Allow 2-3 responses.*

**Key Points to Emphasize:**

- Listening is an active, disciplined practice—not passive
- Silence is not awkward; it's sacred space
- Reflecting back is a gift—it helps people feel SEEN
- Our presence matters more than our words
- You don't have to have answers; you have to have attention

"This is the foundation of coaching: being present, listening deeply, and trusting the process. Everything else we teach builds on this."

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Journaling]

"We've covered a lot of ground today. Before we close, I want to give you space to reflect on your learning.

Find a comfortable position. You can stay in the circle or move to a quieter space in the room. I'm going to offer some reflection prompts. You don't have to answer all of them—just write whatever wants to come out.

**Reflection Prompts:**

1. What stood out to you most today?
2. What's one thing you're learning about yourself as a future recovery coach?
3. What felt challenging or uncomfortable?
4. What are you curious about as we move into Day 2?
5. What's one commitment you want to make to yourself tonight?

You have 15 minutes to write. This is for your eyes only—you won't be asked to share unless you choose to."

*Play soft music if appropriate. Create spaciousness and silence.*

---

**4:15-4:35 — Circle Sharing (20 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Circle]

"Come back to the circle and bring your journal if you'd like.

We're going to do a closing circle. I'll invite each person to share ONE WORD or ONE SENTENCE that captures your experience of today. You can say 'pass' if you prefer to just listen.

I'll start: My word is 'gratitude.' I'm grateful for your openness and willingness to be here."

*Go around the circle. Hold space for each person. Don't comment or analyze—just receive.*

---

**4:35-4:45 — Closing Ritual & Preview of Day 2 (10 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing]

"Thank you for showing up fully today. I know this work is not easy—it requires vulnerability, honesty, and courage. You demonstrated all three.

**Tomorrow (Day 2)**, we'll be building on today's foundation. We'll practice communication skills, dive deep into ethics and boundaries, and start learning about documentation and systems. The Ethics & Boundaries Lab will be a major focus—we'll spend three hours on gray-area scenarios and creating your own ethical framework.

**Before tomorrow, I encourage you to:**
- Review your notes and journal entries
- Get good rest—this work is demanding
- Notice moments when you're making values-based vs. comfort-based decisions
- Practice listening with full presence in your daily interactions

**Before you leave, please take a Core Values Card from the table—choose one that represents your intention for tomorrow.**

*Allow participants to choose cards.*

We'll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Have a restful evening."

**Session Flow:**

| Time | Activity | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| 9:00-9:05 | Welcome Back & Check-In | Facilitator opening |
| 9:05-9:15 | Mindfulness Practice | Guided meditation |

---

**9:00-9:05 — Welcome Back (5 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Day 2 Opening]

"Good morning, and welcome to Day 2. It's great to see you all back.

Yesterday we laid the foundation—we explored the role of the recovery coach, the Core Values framework, and the essential skill of listening. Today we're going to build on that foundation by developing practical skills for the real-world challenges you'll face as coaches.

Before we dive in, let's take a moment to ground ourselves and arrive fully in this space."

---

**9:05-9:15 — Mindfulness Practice (10 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Grounding]

"Find a comfortable seated position. You can close your eyes if that feels right, or soften your gaze toward the floor.

Take a deep breath in... and out.

Notice where you are right now. Notice the chair supporting you. Notice your feet on the ground. Notice the sounds in the room.

Now bring your attention to your breath. Don't try to change it—just notice it. The inhale... the exhale... the natural pause between them.

If your mind wanders—and it will—that's perfectly normal. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath.

[Pause for 5 minutes of silent meditation. You can offer occasional gentle prompts: 'Notice your breath... Notice your body... Come back to this moment...']

Now, slowly bring your awareness back to the room. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, open your eyes.

How we show up matters. Our presence is our greatest tool. Let's carry this groundedness into today's work."

---

### SESSION 2.2: Communication & Powerful Questions (9:15-10:30 AM) — 75 min

**Learning Objective:** Develop skills in asking open-ended, values-based questions

**Materials Needed:**
- Flip chart with "Question Stems"
- Participant workbook (pages 22-25)
- Index cards for practice activity

**Session Flow:**

| Time | Activity | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| 9:15-9:35 | Open vs. Closed Questions | Interactive teaching |
| 9:35-10:00 | Powerful Questions Practice | Paired exercise |
| 10:00-10:20 | Reframing Advice as Questions | Small group work |
| 10:20-10:30 | Integration & Debrief | Large group discussion |

---

**9:15-9:35 — Open vs. Closed Questions (20 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Question Types]

"One of the most important shifts you'll make as a recovery coach is moving from TELLING to ASKING. Instead of giving advice, we ask questions that help people discover their own answers.

But not all questions are created equal. Let's look at the difference between closed and open questions.

**Closed Questions:**
- Can be answered with yes/no or a single word
- Limit exploration and reflection
- Examples: 'Did you go to your meeting?' 'Are you feeling better?' 'Do you have a sponsor?'

**Open Questions:**
- Invite exploration, reflection, and depth
- Begin with What, How, Tell me about...
- Examples: 'What was your experience at the meeting?' 'How are you feeling about your recovery today?' 'Tell me about your support system.'

Now, let's go deeper. The most powerful questions are **VALUES-BASED** questions—questions that connect people to their core values and long-term vision.

**Powerful Question Stems:**

📋 Write these on flip chart:

- 'What matters most to you about...?'
- 'How does this align with your values?'
- 'What would your best self do in this situation?'
- 'What are you learning about yourself?'
- 'If you were giving advice to a friend in this situation, what would you say?'
- 'What would it look like to honor your recovery right now?'
- 'What's one small step you could take toward...?'
- 'How will you know when you're on the right path?'
- 'What support do you need?'
- 'What's possible here?'

Let's practice. I'm going to give you a scenario, and I want you to think of an open, values-based question you might ask.

**Scenario:** Someone says, 'I'm really struggling with cravings lately.'

Turn to a partner and come up with a powerful question."

*Allow 2 minutes for pairs to discuss. Invite 3-4 examples.*

---

**9:35-10:00 — Powerful Questions Practice (25 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Question Practice]

**Purpose:** Practice transforming advice-giving urges into powerful questions

**Setup:**
- Provide index cards with common coaching scenarios
- Participants work in pairs

**Instructions:**

"I'm going to give each pair a stack of scenario cards. On each card, you'll see a common situation a recovery coach might encounter—things like 'Someone wants to leave treatment early' or 'Someone is fighting with their family.'

Your task:
1. Read the scenario
2. Notice what advice you want to give (be honest!)
3. Instead, craft 2-3 powerful, open questions you could ask
4. Practice asking your partner the questions

You'll have 20 minutes to work through as many scenarios as you can."

**Sample Scenario Cards:**
1. "I don't think I need to keep going to meetings. I've been sober for six months."
2. "My sponsor is pushing me to do step work, but I'm not ready."
3. "I got into a fight with my partner and I'm really angry."
4. "I'm thinking about using—I'm so stressed out."
5. "Everyone at work still treats me like I'm the person I used to be."
6. "I don't know if I believe in a higher power. Does that mean I can't recover?"

*Circulate and listen. Offer feedback. Note excellent questions to highlight.*

---

**10:00-10:20 — Reframing Advice as Questions (20 min)**

[FACILITATION ACTIVITY - Group Work]

"Now let's take this a step further. I'm going to share some common pieces of ADVICE that coaches are tempted to give. As a group, let's transform each one into a QUESTION.

I'll do the first one as an example:

**Advice:** 'You should really get a sponsor.'

**Reframed as Question:** 'What kind of support system would help you feel most connected in your recovery?'

Now you try. Here are five more pieces of advice. Work in small groups of 3-4 to reframe each one as a question."

**Advice Statements to Reframe:**
1. "You need to cut off contact with your using friends."
2. "You should tell your family the truth about your relapse."
3. "You have to forgive yourself and let go of the guilt."
4. "You should find a job in recovery—it would be good for you."
5. "You need to focus on yourself and stop worrying about everyone else."

*Allow 10 minutes for small group work. Invite groups to share their reframes.*

---

**10:20-10:30 — Integration & Debrief (10 min)**

"What did you notice during this practice? What was challenging about holding back advice?"

*Field responses. Validate the difficulty.*

**Key Points:**
- The urge to give advice comes from a good place—we want to help
- BUT: advice-giving disempowers the person and centers us as the expert
- Questions invite exploration, honor autonomy, and trust the person's wisdom
- Practice makes this easier—it's a skill, not a personality trait

"Tomorrow, you'll have a chance to practice this in full coaching conversations. For now, notice when you're in advice-giving mode and practice pausing."

---

**Break: 10:30-10:45 AM (15 min)**

**10:45-11:00 — Introduction to Ethics in Recovery Coaching (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Ethics Introduction]

"Welcome to the Ethics & Boundaries Lab. Over the next three hours, we're going to tackle some of the hardest situations you'll face as recovery coaches—situations where there's no clear 'right' answer.

Ethics isn't about memorizing rules. Ethics is about having a FRAMEWORK for making decisions when you're in gray areas. It's about knowing your values, understanding your limits, and being willing to ask for help.

Let me start with a hard truth: **You WILL make ethical mistakes as a coach.** You'll cross a boundary you didn't realize was there. You'll say something that lands wrong. You'll wonder if you did the right thing.

That doesn't make you a bad coach. It makes you human.

What matters is:
1. Do you have a framework for navigating ethical dilemmas?
2. Do you have supervision and support to process complex situations?
3. Are you willing to acknowledge mistakes and make repairs?
4. Are you committed to ongoing learning?

**Core Ethical Principles in Recovery Coaching** (adapted from IC&RC Code of Ethics):

1. **Do No Harm:** Act in the best interest of the people you serve
2. **Respect Autonomy:** Honor self-determination and informed consent
3. **Maintain Boundaries:** Keep clear professional limits
4. **Ensure Confidentiality:** Protect privacy within legal/safety limits
5. **Practice Cultural Humility:** Respect diverse backgrounds and identities
6. **Acknowledge Limitations:** Know your scope and seek consultation
7. **Avoid Dual Relationships:** Don't mix professional and personal roles
8. **Be Accountable:** Take responsibility for your actions and their impact

These principles guide us, but they don't always give us clear answers. That's where the hard work begins."

---

**11:00-11:30 — Ethical Decision-Making Framework (30 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Decision Framework]

"When you're facing an ethical dilemma, it helps to have a structured way to think it through. I'm going to teach you a six-step framework you can use.

**The ETHICS Framework:**

📋 Write on flip chart:

**E - Examine the situation**
- What are the facts? What's actually happening?
- Who is involved? What are their perspectives?

**T - Think about principles**
- Which ethical principles are in play?
- Are there conflicts between principles? (e.g., autonomy vs. safety)

**H - Hear multiple perspectives**
- What would your supervisor say?
- What would the person you're serving want?
- What do your values tell you?

**I - Identify options**
- What are ALL the possible courses of action?
- What are the consequences of each?

**C - Consult and collaborate**
- Who can you talk to? (supervisor, peers, ethics committee)
- What do policies/guidelines say?

**S - Select and act**
- Choose the best option given the circumstances
- Document your decision and reasoning
- Be prepared to explain your choice

Let's practice this framework with a real scenario."

---

**Practice Scenario:**

"You're coaching Malik, who's been in recovery for eight months. During a session, he mentions that he's been selling small amounts of marijuana to make ends meet while he looks for work. He says, 'It's not a big deal—it's legal now, and I'm not using.' He specifically asks you not to tell his probation officer.

What do you do?"

*Present the scenario. Walk through the ETHICS framework as a large group.*

**Facilitation Guide for Walking Through Framework:**

**E - Examine:**
- Malik is selling marijuana (legal in some states, illegal federally/in some states)
- He's on probation (likely violates probation terms)
- He's asking you to keep a secret
- He doesn't see it as problematic for his recovery

**T - Think about principles:**
- Confidentiality (he asked you not to tell)
- Do no harm (is this harmful to his recovery? his legal situation?)
- Respect autonomy (he's making his own choice)
- Legal/safety concerns (probation violation could mean jail time)

**H - Hear perspectives:**
- Malik's view: "It's not a big deal, I'm not using"
- Legal view: Probation violation
- Recovery view: Engaging in illegal activity, proximity to substances
- Your values: Honesty? Safety? Respect for autonomy?

**I - Identify options:**
1. Keep his confidence completely
2. Encourage him to talk to probation officer himself
3. Explore his thinking about the decision without reporting
4. Consult supervisor before deciding
5. Report to probation officer (breaking confidentiality)

**C - Consult:**
- What do your agency policies say about confidentiality?
- What are the limits of confidentiality? (imminent harm, mandated reporting)
- Consult supervisor BEFORE taking action

**S - Select:**
- Most appropriate: Consult supervisor, explore Malik's values around honesty and risk, help him think through consequences, clarify limits of confidentiality

**Key Point:** "You don't have to make this decision alone. When in doubt, consult your supervisor BEFORE taking action."

---

**11:30-12:15 — Gray-Area Roleplay Scenarios, Part 1 (45 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Ethics Roleplays]

**Purpose:** Practice applying ethical framework to complex, realistic scenarios

**Setup:**
- Divide into small groups of 4-5 people
- Each group receives 2 scenario cards
- Groups will roleplay and discuss each scenario

**Instructions to Participants:**

"You're going to practice navigating ethical gray areas. Each small group will receive two scenario cards. For each scenario:

1. One person plays the COACH
2. One person plays the PERSON BEING COACHED
3. Others observe and take notes using the ETHICS framework

After each roleplay (5-7 minutes), debrief as a group:
- What did the coach do well?
- What ethical principles were at play?
- What would you have done differently?
- When would you consult a supervisor?

We'll do two scenarios before lunch."

---

**GRAY-AREA SCENARIO CARDS:**

**Scenario 1: The Dual Relationship**

*You're coaching Sarah, who's been in recovery for two years. She's thriving, and you've built a strong coaching relationship. One day, she invites you to her birthday party at a local restaurant.

- Keeping focus on person being coached
- Modeling vs. advice-giving

---

**1:30-1:45 PM — Break (15 min)**

---

**1:45-2:15 PM — Boundaries Deep Dive (30 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Boundaries]

"Let's talk explicitly about BOUNDARIES. This is one of the hardest aspects of recovery coaching—especially for those of us who have big hearts and strong helping instincts.

**What Are Boundaries?**

Boundaries are the limits we set to protect:
- Our own well-being and energy
- The coaching relationship
- Professional integrity
- The person's autonomy and growth

**Boundaries are NOT:**
- Walls that keep people out
- Rejection or lack of caring
- Rigidity that ignores human connection

**Boundaries ARE:**
- Container for safe, productive work
- Clarity about roles and limits
- Protection against burnout and resentment
- Modeling of healthy relationships

**Common Boundary Challenges for Recovery Coaches:**

1. **Time Boundaries**
   - Staying late in sessions
   - Responding to texts/calls outside work hours
   - Not taking breaks or vacation

2. **Emotional Boundaries**
   - Taking on others' pain as your own
   - Feeling responsible for their outcomes
   - Losing sleep worrying about clients

3. **Physical Boundaries**
   - Hugs, touch, personal space
   - Meeting in inappropriate locations
   - Giving rides or lending money

4. **Information Boundaries**
   - Oversharing personal details
   - Disclosing too much about your recovery
   - Asking intrusive questions

5. **Role Boundaries**
   - Becoming friends
   - Mixing professional/personal relationships
   - Doing things outside your job description

**Boundary-Setting Language:**

Let's practice some clear, compassionate language for setting boundaries.

📋 Write on flip chart:

- 'I care about you AND I need to maintain professional boundaries.'
- 'My role is to support you during our scheduled sessions. For crisis support, here are some 24/7 resources...'
- 'I appreciate you sharing that, and I want to keep our focus on YOUR experience.'
- 'That's outside my scope as a recovery coach. Let me help connect you to someone who can assist with that.'
- 'I hear that you're asking for [X]. I'm not able to do that, AND here's what I CAN offer...'

The key is **clear + compassionate**. We're not being mean; we're being professional."

---

**Boundary Practice Activity (10 min):**

"Turn to a partner. I'll give you a boundary-crossing request. Practice responding with clear, compassionate language.

**Practice Prompts:**
1. 'Can I have your cell number so I can text you when I'm struggling?'
2. 'Can you lend me $20 until my check comes in?'
3. 'Why don't you tell me more about YOUR recovery? I want to know your story.'
4. 'Can you give me a ride home after our session?'
5. 'I added you on Instagram—I want to see what you post about recovery!'

*Allow 8 minutes for paired practice. Invite 2-3 examples of effective responses.*

---

**2:15-2:45 PM — Mini Code of Ethics Creation (30 min)**

[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Personal Code]

**Purpose:** Create a personal ethical framework and commitments

**Setup:**
- Provide sticky notes (different colors if possible)
- Flip chart for each table
- Participant workbook (page 30-32)

**Instructions:**

"You've now worked through complex scenarios and explored boundaries. Now I want you to create your own MINI CODE OF ETHICS—a set of personal principles and commitments that will guide your work as a recovery coach.

**Step 1 (Individual, 10 min):** In your workbook, complete these prompts:

1. The core values I will bring to my coaching work are: _______________
2. The boundaries I commit to maintaining are: _______________
3. When I face an ethical dilemma, I will: _______________
4. I will seek supervision/consultation when: _______________
5. One ethical commitment I make to myself: _______________

**Step 2 (Small Group, 15 min):** Share your personal code with your table group. As a group, identify 5-7 shared commitments you all agree on. Write each commitment on a sticky note.

**Step 3 (Large Group, 5 min):** Each table will share one commitment with the full group. We'll create a collective code."

*Facilitate activity. Post sticky notes on wall to create collective code.*

**2:45-3:00 PM — Lab Integration & Commitments (15 min)**

[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Lab Closing]

"We've done deep, challenging work in this lab. Before we move on, let's take a moment to integrate.

**Reflection Questions:**

Turn to page 32 in your workbook and journal briefly:

1. What was the most challenging scenario for you? Why?
2. What did you learn about your own boundaries?
3. What ethical principle do you need to strengthen?
4. How will you handle ethical uncertainty going forward?

[Allow 5 minutes for journaling]

**Final Thoughts:**

Ethics is not about perfection. It's about:
- Having a framework
- Being willing to consult
- Acknowledging mistakes
- Continuous learning

Remember: **When in doubt, consult.** Your supervisor, your colleagues, your ethics committee—you don't have to figure this out alone.

The fact that you're thinking about ethics THIS deeply means you're already on the right path. Keep asking the hard questions. Keep examining your motives. Keep putting the people you serve at the center.

That's what ethical coaching looks like."

## ASSESSMENT RUBRICS

These rubrics are designed for formative assessment—helping participants grow, not evaluating for pass/fail. Use these tools to:
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Track participant development across the three days
- Guide coaching conversations during practice sessions
- Support self-assessment and peer feedback

**How to Use These Rubrics:**

1. **Observation-Based:** Focus on observable behaviors, not assumptions
2. **Developmental:** Most participants will be in "Developing" at the start; movement toward "Proficient" shows growth
3. **Strengths-Based:** Always start feedback with what's working
4. **Growth-Oriented:** Offer one specific area for development
5. **Non-Judgmental:** Use descriptive language, not evaluative labels

### Appendix B: Core Values Cards Guide

**What Are Core Values Cards?**

Core Values Cards are a deck of cards, each featuring a single value (e.g., honesty, courage, compassion, service, growth, integrity). They serve as a tangible tool for helping people identify and articulate their core values.

**How to Use Core Values Cards in This Training:**

**Day 1, Session 1.1 — Values Cards Circle (Opening Activity):**
- Spread one deck of cards face-up in the center of each table (4-6 participants per deck)
- Invite participants to silently choose one card that represents a value calling to them today
- Go around the circle; each person shares their card and why they chose it
- This builds connection and introduces the values-based approach

**Day 1, Session 1.4 — Values Clarification Exercise:**
- Use cards as a supplement to the printed values list in workbooks
- Participants can lay out cards and physically sort them into "resonates/doesn't resonate"
- Kinesthetic learners especially benefit from this hands-on approach

**Day 1, Session 1.6 — Closing Ritual:**
- Invite participants to choose a Core Values Card that represents their intention for Day 2
- They can keep the card overnight as a physical reminder
- Return cards at the start of Day 2

**Day 3, Session 3.6 — Closing Ceremony:**
- Participants choose a final card representing their commitment as they leave the training
- Optional: Participants can keep this card, or you can photograph them holding their card

**Facilitator Tips:**

- **How Many Decks?** One deck per 4-6 participants (for a training of 20 people, you need 4-5 decks)
- **Where to Get Them?** Core Values Recovery should provide branded decks. Alternatively, create your own using index cards with values written on them.
- **Values to Include** (if creating your own):
  - Honesty, Integrity, Courage, Compassion, Service, Growth, Humility, Gratitude, Responsibility, Connection, Respect, Trust, Authenticity, Love, Forgiveness, Acceptance, Patience, Perseverance, Joy, Peace, Freedom, Dignity, Justice, Wisdom, Hope

**Alternative: Digital or Paper Lists**

If Core Values Cards are unavailable, use the values list printed in participant workbooks. While less tactile, it serves the same purpose.

### Appendix D: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be "in recovery" myself to facilitate this training?**

A: Ideally, yes. This training emphasizes lived experience and the peer support model. Facilitators should have personal recovery experience (substance use and/or mental health) and be comfortable sharing appropriately. However, some co-facilitation models pair peer facilitators with clinical professionals.

---

**Q: What if participants ask questions I don't know the answer to?**

A: It's completely acceptable to say, "I don't know, but I'll find out and get back to you." Model intellectual humility. You can also invite the group to explore the question together. Avoid making up answers.

---

**Q: What if someone becomes emotional or triggered during the training?**

A: This is normal in trauma-informed training about recovery. Offer a break, check in privately, validate their experience, and remind them they can step out anytime. Have resources available (crisis line, EAP, therapist contacts). Don't pressure them to share what's happening.

---

**Q: How do I handle a participant who dominates discussions?**

A: Use facilitation techniques: "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet," use a talking piece, set time limits for sharing, speak privately during break ("I appreciate your engagement AND I want to make sure everyone has space to share").

---

**Q: What if a participant discloses active substance use or suicidal ideation?**

A: Follow your organization's crisis protocols. Speak privately, assess immediate safety, connect to crisis resources if needed (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, crisis text line, local mobile crisis team). Document the incident. You are a facilitator, not a therapist—refer to appropriate professionals.

---

**Q: Can I modify the curriculum to fit a shorter timeframe?**

A: The 21-hour curriculum is designed to meet learning outcomes and state requirements. Shortening it may compromise depth and skill development. If you must condense, prioritize: Day 1 foundations, Day 2 Ethics Lab, and Day 3 Coaching Triads. Consider offering the full training as intended.

---

**Q: What's the ideal participant-to-facilitator ratio?**

A: 1 facilitator per 12-15 participants is ideal. Maximum 20 participants per facilitator. For larger groups, use co-facilitators. The Coaching Triads Practicum requires close observation and feedback, so smaller ratios improve quality.

---

**Q: Should I share my own recovery story?**

A: Yes, but strategically. Use self-disclosure to normalize, build connection, and model vulnerability—not to center yourself or seek validation. Keep it brief (2-3 minutes), relevant to the teaching point, and appropriately boundaried. Always ask yourself: "How does sharing this serve the participants' learning?"

---

**Q: What if participants are at very different places in their recovery (e.g., 2 months vs. 20 years)?**

A: This diversity is valuable! Frame it as strength: "We learn from each other's perspectives." Remind participants that coaching skills don't depend on years in recovery—they depend on willingness to listen, learn, and honor boundaries. Newer folks bring fresh perspective; veterans bring wisdom. Both are needed.

---

**Q: How do I handle participants who want to give advice during coaching practice?**

A: Gently redirect in the moment: "I noticed you offered a suggestion. What question could you ask instead?" Use the rubrics to give feedback. Normalize the advice-giving urge—we all have it. Emphasize that resisting advice is a skill that takes practice.

---

**Q: What if a participant challenges the "no advice-giving" approach?**

A: Acknowledge the tension: "I hear you—it feels counterintuitive. We're trained to help by fixing." Explain the research: advice-giving disempowers, centers the coach as expert, and reduces autonomy. Ask: "Think of a time someone gave you unsolicited advice. How did it feel?" Frame questions as a way to honor the person's wisdom.

---

**Q: Should participants bring real goals to the Coaching Triads Practicum, or should they roleplay?**

A: REAL goals. Roleplaying reduces authenticity and learning. Encourage participants to bring something meaningful but manageable—not their deepest trauma. Examples: planning a difficult conversation, making a decision, building a habit, setting a boundary.

---

**Q: What if someone isn't ready to coach by Day 3?**

A: Normalize this. Not everyone develops at the same pace. Offer encouragement: "This is practice, not performance." Pair less confident participants with supportive partners. Remind them: coaching is a skill that improves with time and supervision.

---

**Q: How do I create psychological safety in the group?**

A: Model it through your facilitation. Establish shared agreements (confidentiality, respect, right to pass). Validate all contributions. Avoid judgment. Share vulnerably yourself. Address microaggressions or disrespect immediately and kindly. Create space for quiet voices.

---

**Q: What accommodations should I offer for participants with disabilities?**

A: Ask in advance what participants need. Offer accessible materials (large print, digital versions, braille if needed). Ensure physical space is accessible (wheelchair access, quiet space for sensory breaks). Provide ASL interpretation if requested. Allow breaks as needed.

---

**Q: How can I make the training culturally responsive?**

A: Use diverse examples and case studies. Acknowledge that recovery looks different across cultures. Invite participants to share cultural perspectives. Avoid assumptions about spirituality, family structures, or recovery pathways. Use inclusive language (they/them pronouns, culturally varied names in scenarios).
