## 📚 PART 1: INTRODUCTION & RATIONALE (20 minutes)

### **The Problem with "One Size Fits All"**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

"Let's start with a truth that might surprise you: **There is no single 'right' way to intervene.**

For decades, the intervention field has been dominated by a single model — the Johnson Model — which emphasized confrontation, surprise, and family ultimatums. And it worked... sort of. It got people into treatment at a high rate. But here's what the research shows: **high initial treatment entry, but extremely poor long-term recovery rates.**

Why? Because the Johnson Model focused only on getting the person to treatment, not on healing the family system. Not on building lasting connection. Not on maintaining dignity.

Then came the backlash: invitational-only models like ARISE and CRAFT, which said, 'Never surprise, never confront, always invite.' And these models work beautifully... **when the Pivot Person is ready, when relationships are intact, when there's no imminent danger.**

But what do we do when:
- The Pivot Person is in denial and refusing all help?
- There's a medical emergency and we have 24 hours to act?
- The family has tried invitation multiple times and the disease has only progressed?
- There's violence, suicidal ideation, or risk to children?

**This is where the Core Values Intervention Continuum comes in.**

We don't believe in one model. We believe in **adaptive intervention** — meeting families where THEY are, assessing what THEY need, and selecting the mode that balances **invitation with urgency, dignity with structure, and autonomy with safety.**"

---

### **The Intervention Continuum Framework**

**[VISUAL: Display spectrum graphic showing 5 modes]**

```
←────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→
MOST INVITATIONAL ←────────────────→ MOST STRUCTURED
←────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→

Mode 1          Mode 2           Mode 3         Mode 4      Mode 5
Collaborative   Structured      Planned        Ad-Hoc      Individual
Invitation      Invitation      Surprise      (Crisis)    Intervention
(ARISE/CRAFT)  (LoveFirst)     (Modified    (Emergency)  (MI-based)
                               Johnson)
```

**Core Principle**: Every intervention exists on a continuum from fully invitational to structured surprise, determined by three factors:

1. **Safety/Urgency** — How imminent is the danger?
2. **Readiness Level** — Where is the Pivot Person on Stages of Change?
3. **Relational Capacity** — How strong are family relationships and communication?

**The Innovation**: We can move fluidly along this continuum based on REAL-TIME ASSESSMENT, while **ALWAYS maintaining dignity, respect, and connection as non-negotiable.**

### **Research Foundations**

**"This isn't just our opinion. This is synthesized from decades of research."**

**[SLIDE: Research Summary]**

| Model | Success Rate | Strengths | Limitations |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **ARISE** (Invitational) | 83% treatment entry (3 weeks), 61% sober at 1 year | Transparent, no secrets, respects autonomy | Requires some readiness, takes time |
| **CRAFT** (Family Training) | 65-75% treatment entry | Improves family functioning, reduces enabling | Requires family commitment to training |
| **LoveFirst** (Grace-based) | Not quantified, clinical success documented | Maintains relationship, ethical excellence | May not work in deep denial |
| **Johnson** (Confrontational) | Highest initial entry | Gets people to treatment quickly | Poor long-term success, damages relationships |
| **MI + Stages of Change** | 70% when matched to stage | Respects autonomy, client-centered | Requires individual readiness |

**Core Values Synthesis**: "We take the best from each model and create a **decision-making framework** that adapts to what each family needs."

## 🔬 PART 2: THE FIVE INTERVENTION MODES (75 minutes total)

---

### **MODE 1: COLLABORATIVE INVITATION** (Most Invitational)

**Research Basis:** ARISE Model, CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training), Motivational Interviewing

**Success Rates:** 83% treatment entry within 3 weeks (ARISE), 65-75% (CRAFT)

#### **When to Use Mode 1:**

✅ **Pivot Person in Contemplation or Preparation stage**
- They're aware there's a problem (even if ambivalent)
- They've expressed openness to "thinking about" help
- They haven't completely rejected the idea of change

✅ **Strong family relationships with open communication**
- Family members can talk honestly without yelling or blaming
- There's a history of problem-solving together
- Trust hasn't been completely destroyed

✅ **No imminent safety crisis**
- No suicidal ideation or plan
- No medical emergency (withdrawal, overdose risk)
- No violence or threat to children

✅ **Previous positive response to support**
- Pivot Person has engaged with help before
- They respond well to encouragement (not control)
- There's evidence they value family opinions

#### **The Collaborative Invitation Process:**

**Phase 1: Initial Contact (Week 1)**
- **Interventionist meets with family** (without Pivot Person initially)
- Assess family dynamics, history, readiness
- Educate family about disease model and enabling
- Train family in CRAFT principles (positive reinforcement, removing rewards for using)

**Phase 2: First Invitation (Week 1-2)**
- **Pivot Person invited to FIRST MEETING**
- Invitation language: "We've been meeting with someone to understand addiction better, and we'd love for you to join us. No pressure, no agenda—just a chance to talk."
- **Full transparency**: No secrets, no surprises, no coercion
- **Interventionist as facilitator**: "I'm here to help everyone be heard"

**Phase 3: Gradually Escalating Engagement (Weeks 2-6)**
- Multiple meetings (2-4 typically)
- Pivot Person hears impact from family (loving, not blaming)
- **Interventionist reflects and translates**: "What I'm hearing from your family is..."
- Treatment options presented as possibilities, not ultimatums
- Pivot Person collaborates on treatment plan

**Phase 4: Coordinated Entry (Week 3-12)**
- When Pivot Person agrees, immediate coordination
- Pre-arranged treatment options (interventionist researched ahead)
- Family trained in ongoing support (no enabling, but connection maintained)

#### **Core Values Integration:**

- **Awareness**: Pivot Person gains awareness through loving feedback and education
- **Coordination**: Network mobilizes around support, not control
- **Care**: Expressed through invitation, choice, and partnership

#### **Key Language:**

**INSTEAD OF**: "You're going to treatment or else"
**USE**: "We've learned that we've been helping you stay sick, and we want to help you get well. Here are some options we've researched. What resonates with you?"

**INSTEAD OF**: "Your addiction is destroying this family"
**USE**: "When you use, we feel scared and helpless. We love you and we want to support your recovery."

#### **Duration:** 3-12 weeks, multiple meetings (typically 3-5 sessions)

#### **Success Indicators:**
- Pivot Person attends meetings willingly
- Open dialogue without defensiveness
- Pivot Person asks questions about treatment
- Family reports reduced enabling behaviors

#### **When to Escalate to Mode 2 or 3:**
- Pivot Person repeatedly refuses to attend meetings
- Using increases despite family efforts
- Medical or safety crisis emerges
- Family exhaustion/burnout

---

### **MODE 2: STRUCTURED INVITATION** (Invitational with Planning)

**Research Basis:** LoveFirst Model, Storti "Heart to Heart" Approach, Systemic Family Intervention

**Success Rates:** Clinically documented success, not quantified in controlled studies

#### **When to Use Mode 2:**

✅ **Pivot Person in Precontemplation stage (unaware of problem)**
- Denial is strong: "I don't have a problem"
- Rationalizes or minimizes consequences
- Blames others for problems caused by using

✅ **Family has some relational capacity but needs structure**
- Relationships strained but not completely fractured
- Family can prepare together without falling apart
- There's enough trust that Pivot Person might listen if approached right

✅ **Moderate urgency (health declining, job at risk)**
- Situation is serious but not immediately life-threatening
- Consequences are mounting (DUIs, job warnings, health issues)
- Window of opportunity exists but closing

✅ **Pivot Person unlikely to engage without structure**
- Previous informal attempts failed
- Pivot Person avoids difficult conversations
- Needs a "formal" setting to take it seriously

#### **The Structured Invitation Process:**

**Phase 1: Family Preparation (Weeks 1-2)**
- **Interventionist meets with family in secret** (Pivot Person not yet invited)
- Educate about disease, enabling, family systems
- **Each family member writes impact statement** (LoveFirst model)
  - "I love you because..."
  - "When you use, I see/feel/experience..."
  - "I want for you..."
- Practice reading statements with interventionist
- Pre-arrange treatment options (ready to go if Pivot Person says yes)

**Phase 2: The Invitation (Week 2)**
- **Family extends formal invitation to Pivot Person**
- Invitation language: "We've been working with someone to better understand how to support you, and we'd like to invite you to meet with us and [interventionist name] on [date] at [time]. This is important to us, and we hope you'll come."
- **Tone**: Serious but loving, not threatening
- If Pivot Person asks "What's this about?": "We want to talk about how we can support you better"

**Phase 3: The Structured Meeting (Week 2-3)**
- **Setting**: Private, comfortable, not threatening (often family home or neutral location)
- **Present**: Interventionist, key family members (3-6 people), Pivot Person
- **Format**:
  1. Interventionist opens: "Thank you for being here. Everyone in this room loves you and is here because they care about your wellbeing"
  2. Family members read impact statements (one at a time, no interruptions)
  3. Interventionist reflects themes: "What I'm hearing is..."
  4. Treatment options presented with dignity: "Your family has researched these options. Would you be willing to consider one?"
  5. **Pivot Person invited to respond**: "What are you hearing? What do you think?"
- **NO ultimatums initially** — focus is on invitation with structure

**Phase 4: Follow-Up**
- If YES: Immediate coordination (car packed, treatment called, go within 24 hours)
- If NO: "We understand this is hard. We're going to continue working on ourselves. We hope you'll reconsider"
- Family sets healthy choices (boundaries): "We love you, AND we're no longer willing to [enable behavior]"

#### **Core Values Integration:**

- **Awareness**: Family awareness first, then creates space for Pivot Person awareness
- **Coordination**: Prepared but not coercive — structure as container for clarity
- **Care**: Structure shows care through thoughtful preparation and follow-through

#### **Key Language (Storti "Heart to Heart"):**

**Opening Statement**: "This isn't an attack. This is an act of love. We've been scared, confused, and we've learned we've been helping in the wrong ways. We want to help in the right ways now."

**Impact Statement Format**:
- "I love you because [specific qualities: your humor, your kindness, the way you...]"
- "When you use, I've noticed [specific behaviors without judgment]"
- "I feel [emotion] because [impact on me]"
- "I want for you [hope, not demand]: a life where you're free, healthy, connected"

**Treatment Invitation**: "We've looked into several options that might be a good fit. [Treatment center] has an opening today/this week. Would you be willing to go?"

#### **Duration:** 2-4 weeks preparation + formal meeting + immediate follow-up

#### **Success Indicators:**
- Family prepared and unified
- Impact statements loving, not blaming
- Pivot Person listens (even if resistant initially)
- Treatment options appropriate and available

#### **When to Escalate to Mode 3:**
- Pivot Person refuses to attend meeting
- Pivot Person attends but is hostile, walks out
- Safety concerns emerge during meeting
- Family consensus that more structure needed

---

### **MODE 3: PLANNED SURPRISE** (Structured Non-Invitational)

**Research Basis:** Modified Johnson Model with Core Values Dignity Principles

**Success Rates:** Johnson Model: Highest initial treatment entry, but poor long-term recovery unless family system addressed

**⚠️ ETHICAL NOTICE:** This mode removes autonomy and should ONLY be used when:
1. Safety risk is high
2. Pivot Person in deep denial (precontemplation)
3. Previous invitational attempts failed
4. Family prepared to maintain long-term support
5. Treatment placement pre-arranged with family involvement plan

#### **When to Use Mode 3:**

✅ **Pivot Person in deep Precontemplation (denial, hostile to help)**
- Refuses to discuss using: "I don't have a problem"
- Angry or hostile when topic raised
- Completely unable or unwilling to see impact

✅ **High urgency (significant health crisis, legal consequences)**
- Medical consequences advancing (liver failure, infections, overdoses)
- Legal system involved (DUI, possession charges, child welfare)
- Job loss, housing loss, relationship collapse imminent

✅ **History of refusing help or leaving treatment AMA (Against Medical Advice)**
- Previous intervention attempts failed
- Attended treatment but left early without completing
- Pattern of saying "yes" then backing out

✅ **Safety concerns (not immediate emergency, but serious)**
- Suicidal ideation without immediate plan
- Driving while intoxicated
- Risk of violence (not imminent, but concerning)
- Children in the home affected by using

#### **The Planned Surprise Process:**

**Phase 1: Secret Family Preparation (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Interventionist meets with family WITHOUT Pivot Person's knowledge**
- **Deep assessment**: Medical history, using patterns, previous attempts, leverage points
- **Treatment pre-arranged**: Bed reserved, insurance verified, admission ready
- **Each family member prepares statement** (similar to Mode 2, but with consequences)
- **Logistics planned**: Who will be present, where, when, transportation, luggage packed
- **Boundaries/consequences clarified**: "If you choose not to go, here's what will change for us"

**Phase 2: The Surprise Meeting (Week 4-6)**

**Setup:**
- **Day/time when Pivot Person most likely sober** (morning often best)
- **Location**: Usually family home (familiar, private)
- **Present**: Interventionist, key family members (4-8 people maximum), possibly employer/pastor/close friend
- **Pivot Person told**: "There's a family meeting" or "Someone needs to talk to you" or arrives home to find group gathered

**The Meeting Format (Johnson-based, Core Values Modified):**

**1. Opening (Interventionist, 2 minutes)**
- **Tone**: Calm, warm, but serious
- "Thank you for being here. I know this is unexpected. Everyone in this room is here because they love you and are deeply concerned about your wellbeing. We're going to ask you to just listen for a little while, and then you'll have a chance to respond."

**2. Impact Statements (Family members, 15-20 minutes)**
- Each person reads pre-written statement
- **Format** (LoveFirst style, NOT aggressive Johnson confrontation):
  - "I love you because..."
  - "I've seen addiction affecting you in these ways: [specific, recent examples]"
  - "I've been contributing to the problem by [enabling behavior]"
  - "I'm here today because I want you to have a chance at recovery"
- **NO interruptions** from Pivot Person during statements
- **Interventionist holds space**: "I know this is hard to hear. Let's let everyone finish"

**3. Interventionist Summary (5 minutes)**
- **Reflects themes**: "What I'm hearing from everyone is deep love and serious concern"
- **Names the disease**: "Your family has learned that addiction is a disease, and they've also learned they've been helping it progress"
- **Presents option**: "Your family has researched treatment options, and there's a bed waiting for you at [treatment center] today. They've packed a bag for you. A car is ready to take you."

**4. The Ask (1 minute)**
- "We're asking you to choose recovery today. Will you go to treatment?"

**5. Response (Variable)**

**If YES:**
- Immediate action: "The car is outside. Your family will ride with you or follow"
- No time for "let me think about it" — go NOW
- Interventionist coordinates with treatment center
- Family receives instructions for communication during treatment

**If NO:**
- **Family shares consequences (NOT punishments, but protective choices)**
  - Partner: "I love you, and I'm no longer willing to live with active addiction. I'm asking you to stay somewhere else until you're in treatment"
  - Parent: "We won't give you money, pay your bills, or let you stay here while you're using"
  - Employer: "Your job is contingent on entering treatment immediately"
- **Interventionist reinforces**:"These are not punishments. These are your family protecting themselves from the disease"
- **Door stays open**: "If you change your mind, call us. The treatment bed is held for 24 hours"

#### **CRITICAL DISTINCTION FROM TRADITIONAL JOHNSON MODEL:**

**Traditional Johnson** (What We DON'T Do):
- ❌ Aggressive confrontation and blame
- ❌ "You're going or else" ultimatum-first approach
- ❌ Shaming or attacking character
- ❌ No follow-up family support
- ❌ Focus solely on getting person to treatment

**Core Values Modified Approach** (What We DO):
- ✅ **Grace under structure**: "This is an act of love, not punishment"
- ✅ **Disease model**: "We're not blaming you for having a disease. We're asking you to treat it"
- ✅ **"We've learned WE need to change"**: Acknowledges family's enabling
- ✅ **Whole system recovery**: Family commits to their own recovery (family coaching, Al-Anon, etc.)
- ✅ **Maintain dignity**: Even in surprise, tone is love and concern, NOT attack

#### **Core Values Integration:**

- **Awareness**: Family has deep awareness of disease and their role; meeting creates sudden awareness for Pivot Person
- **Coordination**: Pre-coordinated care network ready to activate immediately
- **Care**: Expressed as protective action, not punishment ("We love you too much to watch you die")

#### **Duration:** 3-6 weeks preparation + surprise meeting + immediate transport to treatment

#### **Ethical Safeguards:**

**Before using Mode 3, interventionist MUST verify:**
- ☑️ Safety risk assessment completed
- ☑️ Medical evaluation arranged (detox protocol if needed)
- ☑️ Treatment center appropriate and family-involvement model
- ☑️ Family committed to long-term support (not just "drop off and disappear")
- ☑️ Legal considerations addressed (adult capacity, no coercion laws violated)
- ☑️ Backup plan if Pivot Person refuses (where will they go, who will supervise)

**Red Flags — DO NOT USE MODE 3 IF:**
- 🚫 Pivot Person has severe mental health crisis (psychosis, active suicidal plan)
- 🚫 Family motivated by punishment or revenge rather than recovery
- 🚫 No appropriate treatment available (interventionist trying to force-fit)
- 🚫 Legal issues make surprise intervention illegal in your state
- 🚫 Physical violence likely from Pivot Person

#### **Success Indicators:**
- Family unified and prepared
- Treatment is appropriate and available
- Consequences are protective, not punitive
- Follow-up family support plan in place

#### **Post-Intervention Follow-Up:**
- Family coaching continues (whether Pivot Person goes to treatment or not)
- If Pivot Person goes: Family participates in treatment programming
- If Pivot Person refuses: Family maintains consequences with support

---

### **MODE 4: AD-HOC INTERVENTION** (Crisis-Responsive)

**Research Basis:** Emergency medical model, Motivational Interviewing crisis adaptation

**Success Rates:** Variable; depends on leveraging natural consequences and readiness

#### **When to Use Mode 4:**

✅ **Medical emergency (overdose, withdrawal, suicide attempt)**
- Pivot Person in ER, ICU, psychiatric hold
- Medical crisis creates temporary openness
- Window of opportunity: 24-72 hours

✅ **Time-sensitive window (arrested, hospitalized, fired)**
- Legal system involved (jail, court appearance pending)
- Employer intervention ("treatment or you're fired")
- DUI arrest, mandated assessment

✅ **No time for weeks of planning**
- Crisis just happened
- Family calling: "They overdosed last night. What do we do?"
- Treatment bed available NOW but may not be tomorrow

✅ **Pivot Person temporarily open due to consequences**
- Natural consequences broke through denial
- Moment of clarity: "I can't keep living like this"
- Fleeting readiness that may disappear

#### **The Ad-Hoc Process:**

**Phase 1: Rapid Assessment (1-4 hours)**
- **Interventionist contacted urgently** (phone call, text, emergency request)
- **Quick assessment**:
  - What happened? (overdose, arrest, medical crisis)
  - Where is Pivot Person now? (ER, home, jail)
  - Who is present/available? (family members, friends)
  - Medical status? (stable, needs detox, psych evaluation needed)
  - Insurance/financial resources? (to secure treatment bed)
  - Previous treatment history?

**Phase 2: Rapid Coordination (4-24 hours)**
- **Interventionist coordinates with:**
  - Hospital/medical staff (if applicable)
  - Treatment centers (finding available bed FAST)
  - Insurance verification (if time allows)
  - Family (gathering key decision-makers)
- **Treatment secured**: "We have a bed at [center] if he says yes"

**Phase 3: Bedside/Crisis Intervention (1-2 hours)**

**Setting**: Often in hospital, ER, at home post-crisis, or jail

**Format (Motivational Interviewing-based)**:

1. **Meet Pivot Person where they are** (literally and emotionally)
   - "I'm [name], and I work with families affected by addiction. Your [family member] asked me to come talk with you. Is that okay?"
   - **Establish rapport fast**: "How are you feeling right now?"

2. **Acknowledge the crisis without judgment**
   - "That must have been really scary" (overdose)
   - "Sounds like things have been building up for a while" (arrest)
   - **NO shaming**: "You're not a bad person. You have a disease that needs treatment"

3. **Explore ambivalence (MI technique)**
   - "On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make a change?"
   - "What would it take for things to be different?"
   - "What worries you most about what's happening?"

4. **Present treatment as immediate option (not distant idea)**
   - "Your family has found a treatment program that has a bed available today. It's in [location]. They have medical staff, therapy, and a program for people in exactly your situation."
   - "What would need to happen for you to say yes?"

5. **Leverage the natural consequence (not manufactured threat)**
   - "Right now, you have a choice. You can go to treatment today and have support, or you can leave the hospital and figure this out on your own. What makes sense to you?"
   - If legal system involved: "The court is more likely to be lenient if you're in treatment when you appear"

6. **If YES: MOVE IMMEDIATELY**
   - "Okay, let's make that happen. Your family is here to take you, or I can arrange transport"
   - No "let me go home and pack" — use crisis momentum
   - If hospitalized: Coordinate with discharge planning

**Phase 4: Rapid Family Preparation (Concurrent or immediately after)**
- Brief family on treatment expectations
- Set up family participation (if program offers it)
- Connect family to family coach or Al-Anon immediately
- "We got him there. Now YOUR recovery starts"

#### **Core Values Integration:**

- **Awareness**: Crisis creates momentary clarity — interventionist helps name it
- **Coordination**: Rapid resource mobilization with whatever network is available
- **Care**: Meeting Pivot Person in their moment of openness, moving fast to prevent window closing

#### **Key Language:**

**INSTEAD OF**: "You almost died. You have to go to treatment or you'll die next time"
**USE**: "That must have been terrifying. What went through your mind when it happened? What do you want to be different?"

**INSTEAD OF**: "Your family is done with you unless you go to treatment"
**USE**: "Your family loves you and they're scared. There's a bed available right now. What makes sense to you?"

#### **Duration:** 24-72 hours from crisis to treatment placement

#### **Success Indicators:**
- Pivot Person in moment of clarity/openness
- Treatment bed available immediately
- Family able to mobilize quickly
- Medical clearance obtained

#### **Challenges:**
- Window closes fast (denial returns within days)
- Treatment may not be ideal (whatever's available)
- Family not prepared (interventionist coaches on the fly)
- Medical complications (detox needed, psych evaluation)

---

### **MODE 5: INDIVIDUAL INTERVENTION** (One-on-One)

**Research Basis:** Motivational Interviewing, Stages of Change, Individual Coaching Model

**Success Rates:** 70% when matched to readiness stage (MI research)

#### **When to Use Mode 5:**

✅ **Family unavailable or unsafe for Pivot Person**
- Pivot Person estranged from family
- Family is abusive, toxic, or part of the problem
- Pivot Person adult with no close family ties
- Family refuses to participate

✅ **Pivot Person self-refers or employer-refers**
- "I think I need help, but I don't want to involve my family"
- Employer mandates assessment
- Friend refers: "You should talk to someone"
- Pivot Person Googles interventionist and reaches out

✅ **Trust exists between interventionist and Pivot Person**
- Interventionist previously worked with family, now Pivot Person reaches out directly
- Mutual friend made warm introduction
- Pivot Person feels safe with individual (not group) approach

✅ **No immediate family involvement needed/wanted**
- Pivot Person in contemplation stage but family in denial
- Family too fragile for intervention process
- Pivot Person establishing autonomy from enmeshed family

#### **The Individual Intervention Process:**

**Phase 1: Building Rapport (Session 1, 60-90 minutes)**
- **Setting**: Private, comfortable (office, coffee shop, video call)
- **Opening**: "Thanks for reaching out. Tell me what brought you here today"
- **Goals**:
  - Establish trust and safety
  - Assess readiness (Stages of Change)
  - Understand using history and consequences
  - Explore ambivalence
- **No agenda-pushing**: "I'm not here to tell you what to do. I'm here to help you figure out what YOU want"

**Phase 2: Ambivalence Exploration (Sessions 1-3, over 1-3 weeks)**

**Motivational Interviewing Techniques:**

1. **Open-Ended Questions**
   - "What worries you about your using?"
   - "What would be different if you weren't using?"
   - "What's good about using? What's not so good?"

2. **Reflective Listening**
   - Pivot Person: "I don't think I have a problem, but my wife says I do"
   - Interventionist: "So you see it differently than your wife does, and that's creating some tension"

3. **Affirming Strengths**
   - "It takes courage to come talk to someone about this"
   - "You've recognized that something needs to change — that's huge"

4. **Summarizing**
   - "On one hand, you're saying using helps you relax and cope with stress. On the other hand, it's causing problems at work and with your family. Does that sound right?"

5. **Evoking Change Talk**
   - "What would need to happen for you to decide to make a change?"
   - "If you were to cut back or quit, what would that look like?"
   - Listen for DARN-C: Desire, Ability, Reasons, Need, Commitment

**Phase 3: Treatment Planning (Sessions 2-4)**
- **When change talk emerges**:
  - "It sounds like you're leaning toward making a change. What would be the first step?"
  - Present options: IOP, residential, detox, therapy, meetings
  - Collaborative planning: "What feels doable for you?"

- **Address barriers**:
  - "What might get in the way of following through?"
  - "How can we address those obstacles?"

**Phase 4: Connection to Resources (Session 3-6)**
- Help Pivot Person build recovery network
  - Therapist referral
  - Meeting attendance (AA, NA, SMART Recovery)
  - Peer support
  - Medical care (if needed)

- **Coordinate with family later (if appropriate)**
  - "Would it be helpful to bring your family into this process?"
  - Facilitate family meeting if Pivot Person agrees

#### **Core Values Integration:**

- **Awareness**: Individual reflection and insight through Socratic questioning
- **Coordination**: Building network around individual, connecting to resources
- **Care**: Respecting autonomy and timing, meeting person where they are

#### **Key Language (Motivational Interviewing):**

**Avoid "Righting Reflex" (urge to fix)**
- ❌ "You really should go to treatment"
- ✅ "What do you think might be helpful?"

**Roll with Resistance**
- Pivot Person: "I don't think I'm an alcoholic"
- ❌ "The evidence says otherwise"
- ✅ "Tell me more about how you see it"

**Develop Discrepancy**
- "You've said you want to be a good dad and also that using helps you cope with stress. How do those two things fit together?"

**Support Self-Efficacy**
- "You've quit before. What helped you succeed that time?"
- "What makes you think you could do this?"

#### **Duration:** Variable, typically 2-6 sessions over 2-8 weeks

#### **Success Indicators:**
- Pivot Person attends sessions consistently
- Change talk increases over time
- Pivot Person takes actions (research treatment, attend meeting, see doctor)
- Movement along Stages of Change (Precontemplation → Contemplation → Preparation → Action)

#### **When to Involve Family:**
- Pivot Person requests it
- Family could be supportive resource
- Pivot Person in Action stage and needs accountability
- Transition from individual to systemic approach

---

## 🧮 PART 3: INTERVENTION MODE SELECTOR TOOL (30 minutes)

**"Now that you understand the 5 modes, how do you CHOOSE which one to use?"**

### **The Assessment Framework**

Every intervention mode decision rests on three key assessments:

#### **ASSESSMENT 1: SAFETY/URGENCY SCALE** (0-10)

**Question**: "How immediate is the danger to the Pivot Person or others?"

**0-3: LOW URGENCY** (Stable functioning)
- No immediate medical concerns
- No legal issues pending
- Relationships strained but intact
- Consequences mounting slowly
- **Recommended Modes**: Mode 1 or Mode 5

**4-6: MODERATE URGENCY** (Declining health/function)
- Health issues developing (liver enzymes elevated, weight loss, sleep issues)
- Job warnings, attendance problems
- Relationships seriously strained

### **PRACTICE EXERCISE: Mode Selection (25 minutes)**

**[SMALL GROUP ACTIVITY]**

**Instructions to Participants:**

"You're going to work in small groups (3-4 people). I'm going to give you four brief case scenarios. For each one:

1. Score Safety/Urgency (0-10)
2. Identify Readiness Level (Precontemplation/Contemplation/Preparation)
3. Score Relational Capacity (0-10)
4. Recommend an intervention mode
5. Explain your reasoning

You have 15 minutes. Then we'll debrief as a full group."

---

**CASE SCENARIO 1: Sarah, 28**

Sarah has been using opioids for 3 years, starting with prescription painkillers after a car accident. Her husband Mark has been covering for her, taking care of their 5-year-old daughter, and hoping she'd "snap out of it." Last week, he found her unconscious in the bathroom (she had overdosed but woke up when he shook her). She refuses to discuss it, says it was a "one-time mistake," and insists she has it under control. Mark is terrified. Sarah's parents are supportive and willing to help. Sarah still functions at work (barely) but missed several days last month. She's expressed no interest in treatment and gets angry when Mark brings it up.

**Assessment:**
- Safety/Urgency: ___/10
- Readiness Level: _______________
- Relational Capacity: ___/10
- **Recommended Mode**: _______
- **Reasoning**:

---

**CASE SCENARIO 2: Marcus, 45**

Marcus is a successful executive who drinks 1-2 bottles of wine every evening. His wife Jessica has expressed concern multiple times over the past year, and Marcus admits he "probably drinks too much." He's open to the idea of cutting back and has even said "maybe I should talk to someone." No major consequences yet (job stable, health okay), but Jessica notices he's irritable in the mornings and their intimate relationship has suffered. They have a strong marriage and communicate well. Marcus has never been to therapy or treatment, but he's not opposed to the idea.

**Assessment:**
- Safety/Urgency: ___/10
- Readiness Level: _______________
- Relational Capacity: ___/10
- **Recommended Mode**: _______
- **Reasoning**:

---

**CASE SCENARIO 3: Rachel, 35**

Rachel has been using methamphetamine for 5 years. Her family has tried everything: they've begged, threatened, offered to pay for treatment, and even staged an informal intervention 2 years ago (she attended treatment for 5 days, then left AMA). She's now homeless, living in her car. Her parents are heartbroken and exhausted. Rachel is in complete denial, blaming everyone else for her situation. Her 12-year-old son lives with Rachel's parents. Child Protective Services is involved. Rachel's parents are willing to try one more time, but they're not sure Rachel will even show up if they invite her to a meeting. Medical concerns: extreme weight loss, dental problems, skin infections.

**Assessment:**
- Safety/Urgency: ___/10
- Readiness Level: _______________
- Relational Capacity: ___/10
- **Recommended Mode**: _______
- **Reasoning**:

---

**CASE SCENARIO 4: David, 52**

David was arrested for his 3rd DUI last night. He's still in jail. His wife called you this morning in tears: "He's going to lose his job. He's going to go to prison. I don't know what to do." David has been drinking heavily for 10 years. He's been to outpatient treatment twice but never completed. His wife and adult children (ages 22 and 25) are willing to support him, but they're also exhausted and angry. David's lawyer suggested that entering treatment immediately would help his case. There's a treatment center with a bed available today, but David hasn't agreed to go yet. His wife has visitation this afternoon.

**Assessment:**
- Safety/Urgency: ___/10
- Readiness Level: _______________
- Relational Capacity: ___/10
- **Recommended Mode**: _______
- **Reasoning**:

---

**DEBRIEF QUESTIONS** (after small groups report out):

1. "What was challenging about making these assessments?"
2. "Were there scenarios where you disagreed in your group about which mode to use?"
3. "How did safety concerns influence your decisions?"
4. "When might you combine modes or move between them?"
5. "What ethical considerations came up for you?"

---

**ANSWER KEY** (For Facilitator Reference):

**Sarah**: Safety 8, Readiness Precontemplation, Relational 7 → **Mode 3 (Planned Surprise)** with medical assessment or **Mode 2** if family thinks she might attend meeting

**Marcus**: Safety 4, Readiness Contemplation, Relational 9 → **Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation)** or **Mode 5 (Individual)** if he prefers one-on-one

**Rachel**: Safety 8-9, Readiness Precontemplation, Relational 3 → **Mode 3 (Planned Surprise)** or **Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc if crisis)** — complex case, may need CPS coordination

**David**: Safety 7, Readiness unclear (crisis may create openness), Relational 6 → **Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc)** — leverage the arrest window

---

## ⚖️ PART 4: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM (20 minutes)

**"The hardest question in intervention work: When is structure ethical, and when does it become coercion?"**

### **The Ethical Spectrum**

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT]**

"Every intervention mode on the continuum raises ethical questions. Let's be honest about them.

**Mode 1 (Collaborative Invitation)**: Ethically clearest. Respects autonomy, full transparency.

**Mode 2 (Structured Invitation)**: Still invitational, but family prepares in secret initially. **Ethical question**: Is it manipulative to plan before inviting?

**Mode 3 (Planned Surprise)**: Removes autonomy temporarily. **Ethical question**: When is it okay to surprise someone? When does protection become control?

**Mode 4 (Ad-Hoc)**: Leverages natural consequences. **Ethical question**: Are we exploiting vulnerability?

**Mode 5 (Individual)**: Respects autonomy. **Ethical question**: Are we missing the family system piece?

Let's talk about the hardest one: **Mode 3 (Planned Surprise)**."

---

### **When Is Planned Surprise (Mode 3) Ethical?**

#### **ETHICAL IF:**

✅ **Life/Safety at Stake**
- Risk of death from continued using is high
- Medical assessment supports intervention
- Waiting for "readiness" may result in death

✅ **Autonomy Temporarily Impaired by Disease**
- Pivot Person literally cannot see reality due to denial (part of disease)
- Not refusing treatment out of informed choice, but out of disease symptom
- Similar to medical interventions for other conditions affecting decision-making capacity

✅ **Family Committed to WHOLE System Recovery**
- Family not just "getting rid of problem person"
- Family participating in their own recovery (family coaching, Al-Anon, therapy)
- Long-term support plan in place

✅ **Treatment is Appropriate and High-Quality**
- Program offers family involvement
- Clinical care, not punishment-based
- Aftercare plan addresses long-term recovery

✅ **Consequences are Protective, Not Punitive**
- "I won't continue to enable" vs. "I'm cutting you off to punish you"
- Boundaries about what family WON'T do, not what Pivot Person CAN'T do
- Door always open for relationship once recovery begins

---

#### **UNETHICAL IF:**

🚫 **Motivated by Punishment/Revenge**
- Family wants Pivot Person to "learn a lesson" or "suffer"
- Anger driving the process more than love
- Interventionist senses vindictiveness

🚫 **No Follow-Up Support Plan**
- Family plans to "drop off and disappear"
- No commitment to family recovery work
- Treatment center doesn't involve family

🚫 **Treatment Placement Inappropriate**
- "Any bed will do" mentality
- Financial kickback to interventionist (UNETHICAL)
- Program known to be low-quality or harmful

🚫 **Legal or Safety Issues Make It Coercive**
- State laws prohibit certain forms of intervention
- Physical restraint or false imprisonment
- Threats of violence or harm

🚫 **Family Divided or in Conflict**
- Half the family supports intervention, half opposes
- Intervention being used to "win" family power struggle
- Pivot Person being used as pawn in family dysfunction

---

### **Maintaining Dignity in Mode 3**

**"If you must use planned surprise, these practices maintain dignity:"**

1. **Tone is Love, Not Attack**
   - Impact statements focus on "I love you" not "You're terrible"
   - No yelling, name-calling, or shaming
   - Interventionist models calm, compassionate presence

2. **Respect Personhood, Even When Removing Choice**
   - "We respect your autonomy, AND we can't watch you die"
   - Acknowledge the violation: "We know this feels like an ambush, and we're sorry for that. We didn't know another way to help"

3. **Explain the Why**
   - "This is happening because we've tried other approaches and the disease has only progressed"
   - "We've learned that waiting for you to be 'ready' means waiting for you to die"

4. **No Physical Force**
   - If Pivot Person says no, they say no (except in emergency medical situations)
   - Consequences are relational/financial boundaries, not physical restraint

5. **Long-Term Relationship Focus**
   - "We hope you choose treatment today, AND if you don't, we still love you"
   - Family stays connected (with boundaries) even if Pivot Person refuses

---

### **The Core Values Ethics Checkpoint**

**Before finalizing any intervention plan, interventionist asks:**

#### **The Four Questions:**

1. **Is this intervention rooted in LOVE or in CONTROL?**
   - If control: Stop. Rethink. Consult supervisor.

2. **Am I respecting the DIGNITY of every person involved?**
   - If no: Adjust tone, language, approach.

3. **Is the FAMILY committed to their own recovery?**
   - If no: Start with family coaching first.

4. **Do I have a FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST?**
   - If yes: Recuse yourself or disclose fully and get consent.

**If you can't answer these four questions with integrity, you shouldn't proceed.**
