    <h3>Core Values Intervention Philosophy</h3>

    <div class="philosophy-section">
        <h4>What Is Intervention?</h4>
        <blockquote>
            "Intervention is a guided process of connectionâ€”bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move from crisis to recovery. The outcome of intervention is connection, honesty, and hope."
        </blockquote>

        <h4>The Three Stages of Recovery</h4>
        <p>Recovery unfolds in phases. Understanding where clients are helps us meet them with what they needâ€”not what we think they should need. These stages apply to both the Pivot Person and their family system.</p>

        <h4>What Makes Core Values Different</h4>
