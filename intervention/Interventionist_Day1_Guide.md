## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### 9:00-9:05 ‚Äî WELCOME & LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Opening]**

*Stand in a welcoming posture. Make eye contact with participants as they settle. Take a breath. Begin when energy settles.*

"Good morning, and welcome. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that we gather on [indigenous land acknowledgment appropriate to your location]. We honor the original stewards of this land and recognize that recovery and healing have been part of indigenous wisdom for generations before Western intervention models existed.

My name is [your name], and I'm honored to be your guide for these next three days. I say 'guide' intentionally, because I'm not here as an expert with all the answers. I'm here as someone who has walked this path, who continues to learn, and who deeply respects the wisdom each of you brings to this circle.

Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge something important: **many of you are here because you have lived experience with addiction** ‚Äî whether your own recovery, a family member's struggle, or professional work in the field. That lived experience is not a deficit. It is your greatest asset as an interventionist.

This training is different from traditional professional development. We're not going to sit in rows while I lecture at you. We're going to practice, roleplay, reflect, and sometimes sit with discomfort. This requires trust, vulnerability, and respect. I'll be modeling these qualities, and I invite you to do the same.

Let's begin by going around the room. Please share:
1. **Your first name**
2. **One word** that describes why you're here today

I'll start: My name is [your name], and my word is '**service**' ‚Äî because I believe intervention is one of the highest forms of service to families in crisis."

*Facilitate round-robin introductions. Listen actively. Notice themes. After everyone has shared:*

"Thank you. I heard words like [reflect 3-4 themes you noticed: connection, healing, hope, purpose]. Those words will guide us over the next three days."

---

### 9:05-9:10 ‚Äî FACILITATOR INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Personal Story]**

*Share your brief personal story if appropriate. Model vulnerability without making it about you. 2-3 minutes maximum.*

"Let me tell you briefly why I do this work. [Share your connection to intervention/recovery ‚Äî could be personal recovery, family member's addiction, professional calling. Keep it focused on WHY this work matters, not your entire story.]

What I've learned through [X years] of doing this work is that **intervention is sacred**. We are invited into families' most vulnerable moments. We hold space for crisis, fear, love, and hope all at once. It's work that will test you, transform you, and demand your very best.

My promise to you is this: I will show up with honesty, respect, and care. I will challenge you when needed and support you always. I won't have all the answers, and I'll tell you when I don't know something. And most importantly, **I will model the 'guide not guru' stance** that we're asking you to embody.

Now, let's connect through a Core Values exercise."

---

### 9:10-9:25 ‚Äî VALUES CARDS CIRCLE (15 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - Values Cards]**

**Purpose**: Connect participants to their core values and create initial bonding through shared reflection.

**Setup**:
- Core Values Cards deck in the center of each table (face-up, visible to all)
- 4-6 people per table/circle

**Instructions to Participants**:

"Now we're going to do an activity called the **Values Cards Circle**. You'll notice there's a deck of Core Values Cards in the center of your table. These cards represent different values that guide us in recovery and in life ‚Äî things like integrity, courage, compassion, service, humility, connection, honesty, growth.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1** (2 minutes): Take a moment to look through the cards silently. You're looking for one card that represents a **core value that's calling to you today** ‚Äî something that feels alive for you right now as you begin this training.

**Step 2** (10 minutes): Once everyone has selected a card, we'll go around your table. Share:
   - Your name
   - Your card (the value)
   - A brief story (30-60 seconds) about **why this value matters to you today**

**Step 3** (3 minutes): After everyone shares, I'll invite some reflections from the full group.

**Important**: As others share, practice **listening with your full presence**. Notice what resonates. Don't prepare your response while others are talking ‚Äî just be present.

You have two minutes to choose your card. Begin."

*Walk around room. Observe. Notice engagement. After 2 minutes:*

"Okay, let's hear from each table. Go ahead and begin your circle sharing."

*Allow 8-10 minutes for table sharing. Walk around. Listen to snippets. Notice energy.*

**Debrief Questions** (full group, 3 minutes):
- "Who would like to share something that resonated at your table?"
- "Were there any common themes?"
- "How did it feel to be listened to so deeply?"
- "What did you notice about yourself as you listened to others?"

*Affirm responses. Transition:*

"Beautiful. This practice ‚Äî choosing values consciously and articulating them ‚Äî is at the heart of the work we're going to do as interventionists. When families are in crisis, they've lost touch with their values. Our job is to help them reconnect. We just practiced that skill."

---

### 9:25-9:28 ‚Äî SHARED AGREEMENTS (3 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Group Agreements]**

"Before we dive into content, let's co-create some **shared agreements** for our time together. These are the norms that will help us create a safe, respectful, and productive learning space.

I'll offer a few suggestions, and then I invite you to add your own. What do we need from each other to learn well together?"

*Write on flip chart as you speak:*

**Suggested Agreements:**
- **Confidentiality**: What's shared here stays here (unless safety concern)
- **Respect**: Honor each person's story and perspective
- **Right to Pass**: You can always choose not to share
- **One Mic**: One person speaks at a time
- **Assume Positive Intent**: Give each other grace
- **Whole Self Welcome**: Bring your full experience ‚Äî joys, struggles, questions
- **Learning Stance**: We're all students here, including the facilitator

"What else would you like to add?"

*Write participant suggestions. Examples may include: timeliness, devices on silent, ask questions, challenge respectfully, share airtime.*

"Great. These agreements will guide us for the next three days. I'll post this where we can all see it, and if we drift, anyone can gently point us back to these agreements."

---

### 9:28-9:30 ‚Äî OVERVIEW & LOGISTICS (2 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Logistics]**

"Quick overview of what to expect:

**Day 1 (Today)**: We'll explore the foundations ‚Äî what is intervention, what is recovery, how do systems work, and what language matters.

**Day 2 (Tomorrow)**: We'll build skills ‚Äî roles and boundaries, the **Intervention Continuum** (our signature framework), and we'll set up a case study for Day 3.

**Day 3 (Wednesday)**: We'll practice ‚Äî you'll do a live intervention simulation, we'll debrief ethically, and you'll prepare for your 40-week mentorship journey.

**Logistics:**
- **Breaks**: 10:30-10:45 AM, 2:30-2:45 PM (15 minutes each)

## Detailed Content & Scripts

### 9:30-9:40 ‚Äî HISTORY OF INTERVENTION MODELS (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - History]**

"Let's start with some history, because understanding WHERE intervention came from helps us understand where we're going.

**The Johnson Model (1960s-1990s)**

The first formalized intervention model was developed by Dr. Vernon Johnson in the 1960s. Dr. Johnson was an Episcopal priest who observed that people with addiction rarely sought help until they 'hit bottom' ‚Äî and by then, many had died. He asked: **'What if we could raise the bottom?'**

His model: **Direct confrontation**. Gather family and friends, surprise the person, read letters describing how their addiction hurt you, deliver an ultimatum: 'Go to treatment now or face consequences.'

**Did it work?** Sort of. The Johnson Model had the **highest treatment entry rate** ‚Äî people went to treatment. **But** ‚Äî and this is critical ‚Äî it had **poor long-term recovery success**. Why? Because it focused only on getting the person to treatment, not on healing the family system. It often damaged relationships. It was based on shame and control, not connection.

**The ARISE Model & CRAFT (1990s-2000s)**

In response, researchers developed **invitational models**:
- **ARISE** (Dr. Judith Landau): Pivot Person invited from the start. No secrets, no surprise. Success rate: **83% treatment entry, 61% sober at one year**.
- **CRAFT** (Dr. Robert Meyers): Train family members to change their behaviors, reduce enabling, use positive reinforcement. Success rate: **65-75% treatment entry**.

These models work beautifully when:
- The person is somewhat ready (contemplation stage)
- Relationships are intact enough for invitation
- There's time to do weeks of preparation

**The Problem**: What about when there's no time? When the person is in deep denial? When medical crisis is imminent?

**The Core Values Synthesis (2020s)**

That's where **Core Values Intervention** comes in. We believe:
- **Invitation is primary**, but structure is sometimes necessary
- There is **no one-size-fits-all model**
- Intervention must **adapt to what each family needs**
- **Dignity, respect, and connection are non-negotiable** ‚Äî even in structured interventions

Tomorrow, you'll learn the **Intervention Continuum** ‚Äî our signature framework that integrates the best research and allows you to adapt your approach."

---

### 9:40-9:55 ‚Äî CORE VALUES DEFINITION (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Definition]**

"So, what IS an intervention? Let's start with what most people think it is."

*Ask participants:* "When you hear the word 'intervention,' what image comes to mind? Shout it out."

*Write responses on flip chart. Likely responses: TV show, ambush, confrontation, crying, ultimatum, family gathering*

"Right. Most people think of the TV show *Intervention* ‚Äî dramatic, confrontational, sometimes even violent. **That's NOT what we do.**

Here's the **Core Values definition** ‚Äî I invite you to write this down:

**An intervention is a guided process of connection ‚Äì bringing together the people, information, resources, and actions needed to help someone move away from crisis and toward recovery.**

Let's break that down word by word:

**'GUIDED PROCESS'** ‚Äî It's not an event. It's a process. And it's guided by a professional who knows systems, addiction, and how to coordinate care.

**'OF CONNECTION'** ‚Äî This is the key. Connection is both the PROCESS (how we do it) and the OUTCOME (what we're trying to create). We're not severing the relationship. We're restoring it.

**'BRINGING TOGETHER'** ‚Äî Intervention is about coordination. People, information, resources, actions. All working together.

**'MOVE AWAY FROM CRISIS'** ‚Äî We meet families in crisis. Our job is to stabilize, clarify, and create a pathway forward.

**'TOWARD RECOVERY'** ‚Äî Not just treatment. **Recovery**. Which brings us to our next key point..."

*Pause. Make eye contact.*

"Intervention IS recovery. It's not a one-time event. It's the beginning of a lifelong journey ‚Äî for the Pivot Person AND for the family."

---

### 9:55-10:10 ‚Äî THE THREE PILLARS (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Three Pillars]**

"Every intervention ‚Äî whether invitational or structured, whether it takes three weeks or three days ‚Äî rests on **three pillars**:

**üîç PILLAR 1: AWARENESS**

**Awareness** is the foundation. Before anything can change, people need to SEE what's happening.

For the **family**:
- Awareness that addiction is a disease (not a moral failing)
- Awareness of how they've been enabling (with love, but still enabling)
- Awareness of their own patterns, triggers, and needs

For the **Pivot Person**:
- Awareness that there's a problem (breaking through denial)
- Awareness of the impact on others
- Awareness that recovery is possible

For the **interventionist**:
- Awareness of family dynamics, power structures, trauma history
- Awareness of your own biases, triggers, limitations
- Awareness of resources and treatment options available

**Discussion Question**: *Ask group* "What happens if we try to intervene without awareness? What goes wrong?"

*Allow responses: premature action, blame, missed opportunities, enabling continues*

"Exactly. **Awareness must come first.**

**ü§ù PILLAR 2: COORDINATION**

**Coordination** is the architecture. Intervention is not solo work. It's team sport.

The interventionist's job is to **coordinate**:
- The family network (who's present, who's not, why)
- The treatment plan (residential, IOP, detox, therapy, meetings)
- The professional team (therapist, coach, peer support, doctor)
- The follow-up care (family coaching, monitoring, accountability)

Remember: **Recovery requires a coordinated team**:
- Professional interventionist
- Intensive treatment (90+ days)
- Peer-based meetings
- Therapy
- Peer support
- Family support
- Accountability

**If the team isn't coordinated, people fall through the cracks.** The Pivot Person goes to treatment, but family doesn't do their work. Or therapist doesn't know what coach is doing. Or peer support never happens.

**Our job as interventionists**: Be the conductor of the orchestra. Make sure everyone knows the score.

**‚öïÔ∏è PILLAR 3: CARE**

**Care** is how we show up. It's the HOW behind the WHAT.

Care means:
- **Dignity** ‚Äî Treating every person with respect, even when they can't make good choices
- **Compassion** ‚Äî Leading with love, not judgment
- **Follow-through** ‚Äî Not disappearing after the intervention
- **Long-term commitment** ‚Äî 40-week mentorship, not one-and-done

Care also means **self-care** for the interventionist:
- Setting boundaries
- Seeking supervision
- Processing vicarious trauma
- Not taking on families beyond your capacity

**Discussion Question**: *Ask group* "How do we express care in a structured intervention where the person doesn't have full autonomy?"

*Allow responses. Affirm nuance. Transition:*

"This tension ‚Äî between **respecting autonomy** and **protecting safety** ‚Äî is at the heart of ethical intervention. We'll dive deep into this tomorrow when we talk about the Intervention Continuum."

---

### 10:10-10:25 ‚Äî SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION (15 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS - What Intervention IS and ISN'T]**

"Now I want you to work in small groups to process what we've covered. Form groups of 3-4 people (tables work well)."

**Discussion Prompts** (write on flip chart):

1. **Based on what you've heard, what IS intervention?** (2-3 key characteristics)
2. **What ISN'T intervention?** (What are common misconceptions?)
3. **Which of the three pillars (Awareness, Coordination, Care) feels most natural to you? Which feels most challenging?**

"You have 12 minutes. Choose someone to share one key insight from your group when we come back together."

*Circulate among groups. Listen. Notice themes. After 12 minutes, call time:*

**Large Group Debrief** (3 minutes):
- "What's one insight from your group about what intervention IS?"
- "What's one misconception you want to clear up?"
- "Which pillar feels most challenging, and why?"

*Affirm responses. Synthesize themes.*

---

### 10:25-10:30 ‚Äî TRANSITION TO BREAK (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Transition]**

"Beautiful reflections. Let's anchor what we've covered:

**Intervention** is a guided process of connection ‚Äî bringing together people, information, resources, and actions to move from crisis to recovery.

**The three pillars** are Awareness, Coordination, and Care.

**Core Values approach** integrates the best research (ARISE, CRAFT, LoveFirst, Storti) and creates an adaptive framework.

When we come back from break, we're going to talk about **recovery** ‚Äî what it is, what it isn't, and why understanding recovery deeply is essential to being a good interventionist.

**Break time: 10:30-10:45 (15 minutes)**. See you back here at 10:45."

## Detailed Content & Scripts

### 10:45-10:55 ‚Äî WHAT IS RECOVERY? (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Recovery Definition]**

"Welcome back. Let's dive into a question that's at the heart of intervention work: **What is recovery?**

*Ask participants:* "When you hear the word 'recovery,' what does it mean to you? Shout it out."

*Write responses on flip chart. Likely responses: sobriety, treatment, meetings, not using, healing, process*

"Good. I heard [repeat themes]. Now let me share the **Core Values definition**:

**Recovery is a lifelong process of reclaiming your connection to your values, meaning, and purpose ‚Äî usually from a loss caused by addiction.**

Let's unpack this:

**'LIFELONG PROCESS'** ‚Äî Recovery is not a destination. It's not something you achieve and then you're done. It's a daily practice, a way of being, a commitment renewed over and over.

This is CRITICAL for interventionists to understand, because families often think: **'If we can just get him to treatment, everything will be fixed.'**

And we have to gently correct that: **'Treatment is the beginning. Recovery is the rest of their life ‚Äî and yours.'**

**'RECLAIMING YOUR CONNECTION'** ‚Äî The word 'reclaim' is important. It suggests that the connection to values, meaning, and purpose was ALWAYS there ‚Äî addiction just obscured it. Recovery is remembering who you really are.

**'TO YOUR VALUES, MEANING, AND PURPOSE'** ‚Äî Recovery is not just 'not using.' It's building a life that matters. A life aligned with what you care about most. A life with direction.

**'FROM A LOSS CAUSED BY ADDICTION'** ‚Äî Addiction causes loss. Loss of relationships, health, jobs, homes, dignity, self-respect. Recovery is about grieving those losses AND reclaiming what's possible moving forward.

**Discussion Question**: *Ask group* "How does this definition differ from what you thought recovery was before today?"

*Allow responses. Affirm shifts in understanding.*

---

### 10:55-11:15 ‚Äî RECOVERY VS. TREATMENT VS. SOBRIETY (20 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY - Distinctions Exercise]**

"Let's get clear on some terms that often get confused. I'm going to put three columns on the flip chart:

**TREATMENT | RECOVERY | SOBRIETY**

Your job: Tell me what distinguishes each of these. What is **treatment**? What is **recovery**? What is **sobriety**?"

*Write participant responses under each column. Guide toward these distinctions:*

**TREATMENT:**
- Time-limited (30, 60, 90 days residential; 8-12 weeks IOP)
- Clinical intervention (therapy, medical supervision, structure)
- Intensive work on trauma, coping skills, understanding disease
- **Purpose**: Stabilization, education, initial behavior change
- **Outcome**: Ready to BEGIN recovery

**RECOVERY:**
- Lifelong process (decades, entire life)
- Ongoing practice (meetings, therapy, self-reflection, values alignment)
- Includes treatment, but extends far beyond it
- **Purpose**: Building a life worth living, aligned with values
- **Outcome**: Continuous growth, connection, meaning

**SOBRIETY:**
- Abstinence from substances (counting days)
- Necessary but not sufficient
- You can be sober without being in recovery (dry drunk)
- **Purpose**: Remove the substance
- **Outcome**: Physical abstinence

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Distinctions]**

"Here's the key insight: **Sobriety is necessary. Treatment is essential. But recovery is the goal.**

You can be **sober** without being in **recovery**. That's called being a 'dry drunk' ‚Äî abstinent but miserable, not growing, not connected to values.

You can complete **treatment** without committing to **recovery**. That's when people relapse 30 days after residential. Treatment gave them tools, but they didn't use them.

**Recovery** requires:
- ‚úÖ Sobriety (abstinence from substances)
- ‚úÖ Treatment (intensive clinical work)
- ‚úÖ Ongoing support (meetings, therapy, peer support, family connection)
- ‚úÖ Values alignment (living according to what matters most)
- ‚úÖ Purpose and meaning (a life worth staying sober for)

**As interventionists, our job is to help families understand this distinction.**

When a family hires you, they're often thinking: **'Just get him to treatment.'**

Our job is to expand their understanding: **'Treatment is step one. Recovery is a team sport. Here's what the whole family will need to commit to...'**"

---

### 11:15-11:35 ‚Äî SYSTEMIC RECOVERY (20 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Family Systems]**

"Now, the piece that sets Core Values apart from many intervention models: **Recovery belongs to the whole system, not just the Pivot Person.**

Let me say that again: **The recovery belongs to the whole system.**

**Why?** Because addiction is a **family disease**. Not in the sense that it's genetic (though it can be), but in the sense that **addiction affects everyone in the system**.

When one person is using:
- **Parents** become enablers or controllers
- **Partners** become caretakers or police officers
- **Children** become parentified or invisible
- **Siblings** become resentful or also start using
- **Friends** drift away or also use

The family **organizes itself around the addiction**. Roles get rigid. Communication becomes dishonest. Values get lost.

**Here's what most families don't understand**: Even when the Pivot Person goes to treatment and gets sober, **the family system doesn't automatically heal**.

The family has to do THEIR work:
- Recognize enabling patterns
- Set healthy choices (boundaries)
- Communicate honestly
- Grieve losses
- Rebuild trust
- Find their own values again

**This is why Core Values Intervention emphasizes**:
- **Family coaching** (not just individual coaching)
- **Peer support for family members** (Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, family therapy)
- **Long-term family involvement** (40-week mentorship includes family)

**Interventionist's Role in Systemic Recovery:**

As an interventionist, you work **FOR the family/network**, not just for the Pivot Person. You:
- Help the family see their role in the system
- Educate about enabling vs. supporting
- Connect family to resources (family coach, Al-Anon, therapy)
- Model healthy communication
- Hold the family accountable to THEIR recovery

**Discussion Question**: *Ask group* "How many of you have seen a family where the person got sober, but the family stayed stuck in old patterns? What happened?"

*Allow responses. Common theme: relapse, resentment, family dysfunction continues*

"Exactly. **Individual recovery without systemic recovery is fragile.** That's why we emphasize: **Recovery is a team sport.**"

---

### 11:35-11:55 ‚Äî PERSONAL RECOVERY STORIES (20 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY - Small Group Sharing]**

**Purpose**: Create space for participants to connect their own recovery stories (personal or professional) to the concepts of lifelong process and systemic recovery.

**Instructions to Participants**:

"We're going to take some time now for personal reflection and sharing. I'm going to ask you to think about a recovery story ‚Äî either your own, or someone close to you, or a client you've worked with.

Find a partner (or group of 3 if odd number). You'll each have 5-7 minutes to share. The prompt is:

**'Tell a story about recovery as a lifelong process or systemic journey. What did you learn from this experience?'**

**Guidelines:**
- This is confidential
- You can share as much or as little as feels comfortable
- Practice deep listening ‚Äî don't interrupt or offer advice
- If you need to pass, that's okay

You have 15 minutes total. Begin."

*Facilitator: This is a tender moment. Walk around. Observe. Notice energy. Some participants may get emotional. That's okay. Have tissues available. After 15 minutes:*

**Debrief** (5 minutes, full group):
- "Who would like to share something that came up for you in that conversation?" (Ask for volunteers, don't force)
- "What did you notice about recovery as a lifelong process?"
- "How does understanding systemic recovery change how you think about intervention?"

*Affirm responses.*

### 11:55-12:00 ‚Äî TRANSITION TO LUNCH (5 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Summary]**

"Thank you for your honesty and presence in that exercise. What I heard is [name 2-3 themes that emerged].

Let's anchor what we've covered this morning:

**Session 1.2**: Intervention is a guided process of connection, built on three pillars (Awareness, Coordination, Care).

**Session 1.3**: Recovery is a lifelong process of reclaiming connection to values, meaning, and purpose. It belongs to the whole family system, not just the Pivot Person.

**Why this matters for interventionists**: If we don't understand recovery deeply, we can't help families navigate it. We'll think our job is done when the person goes to treatment. But that's just the beginning.

Okay, **lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM**. We'll reconvene at 1:00 for our afternoon session on **Systems Thinking in Recovery** ‚Äî where we'll actually map out family systems and practice identifying patterns.

Enjoy your lunch. See you at 1:00."

### 1:00-1:20 ‚Äî SYSTEMS THEORY 101 (20 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Systems Theory]**

"Welcome back. This afternoon we're diving into **systems thinking** ‚Äî one of the most powerful lenses for understanding families affected by addiction.

**What is a system?**

A **system** is a set of interconnected parts that function together as a whole. When you change one part, every other part adjusts.

Think of a mobile hanging from a ceiling. If you push one piece, every other piece moves. That's a system.

**Families are systems.**

In a healthy family system:
- Communication is open and honest
- Roles are flexible (people can adapt)
- Boundaries are clear but not rigid
- Members support each other's growth
- The system adapts to change (kids grow up, parents age, life happens)

**In a family affected by addiction:**
- Communication becomes dishonest (secrets, denial)
- Roles become rigid (everyone gets stuck in a pattern)
- Boundaries become either too loose (enabling) or too rigid (estrangement)
- Members organize around the addiction (the using person becomes the center)
- The system resists change (homeostasis: 'This is how we've always been')

**Key Principles of Systems Theory:**

**1. The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts**
You can't understand a family by looking at individuals in isolation. You have to see the relationships, the patterns, the invisible rules.

**2. Circular Causality (Not Linear)**
It's not 'Dad drinks BECAUSE Mom nags.' It's circular: Dad drinks ‚Üí Mom nags ‚Üí Dad drinks more ‚Üí Mom nags more. Breaking the cycle requires changing BOTH parts.

**3. Homeostasis (System Seeks Stability)**
Even dysfunctional systems seek stability. The family organizes around the addiction because it's predictable. When the person gets sober, the system feels unstable ‚Äî that's why families sometimes sabotage recovery without meaning to.

**4. Identified Patient (IP) is the Symptom Bearer**
The Pivot Person (identified patient) is the one with obvious symptoms, but they're often carrying the dysfunction of the whole system. When they get better, other issues in the family may surface.

**Discussion Question**: *Ask group* "Have you ever seen a family where one person got sober, but then another family member started having problems? What was that about?"

*Allow responses. Guide toward: system seeking balance, symptoms shifting*

"Exactly. **This is why systemic intervention matters.** If we only focus on getting the Pivot Person to treatment, we miss the larger system. And the system will pull them back."

---

### 1:20-1:45 ‚Äî FAMILY ROLES IN ADDICTION (25 minutes)

**[PRESENTATION - Family Roles]**

"One of the most useful frameworks for understanding family systems in addiction is the **Family Roles Model**, developed by therapists Sharon Wegscheider-Cruse and Claudia Black.

When addiction is present, family members unconsciously take on roles to cope with the chaos. These roles become rigid and limit everyone's growth.

**Let me describe the five common roles:**

**1. THE ENABLER / CARETAKER** (Often partner or parent)
- **Behavior**: Makes excuses, covers up consequences, protects the using person from reality
- **Motivation**: Love, fear, anxiety ('If I don't take care of them, who will?')
- **Cost**: Exhaustion, resentment, loss of self
- **What they need in recovery**: Learn healthy choices (boundaries), self-care, stop rescuing

**2. THE HERO / RESPONSIBLE ONE** (Often oldest child)
- **Behavior**: Overachieves, takes on adult responsibilities, tries to make the family look good from outside
- **Motivation**: Control the chaos, make everything okay, earn approval
- **Cost**: Perfectionism, anxiety, inability to ask for help
- **What they need in recovery**: Permission to be imperfect, share burdens

**3. THE SCAPEGOAT / ACTING-OUT CHILD** (Often second child or adolescent)
- **Behavior**: Gets in trouble, uses substances, rebels, draws negative attention
- **Motivation**: Divert attention from Pivot Person, express family pain outwardly
- **Cost**: Legal problems, addiction, estrangement
- **What they need in recovery**: Healing, positive attention, healthier expression

**4. THE LOST CHILD / INVISIBLE ONE** (Often middle or younger child)
- **Behavior**: Withdraws, stays quiet, avoids conflict, flies under the radar
- **Motivation**: Safety through invisibility ('If I'm not noticed, I won't get hurt')
- **Cost**: Loneliness, lack of identity, difficulty forming relationships
- **What they need in recovery**: Visibility, voice, connection

**5. THE MASCOT / FAMILY CLOWN** (Often youngest child)
- **Behavior**: Uses humor to deflect, keeps things light, provides comic relief
- **Motivation**: Reduce tension, distract from pain
- **Cost**: Not taken seriously, masks own pain, anxiety
- **What they need in recovery**: Permission to be sad/scared, be taken seriously

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT continued]**

"Important: **These roles are not personality types.** They're **coping strategies** that become rigid in dysfunctional systems.

**In intervention, understanding these roles helps us:**
- Predict who will support intervention (often Hero, sometimes Enabler when exhausted)
- Predict who will resist (sometimes Scapegoat, sometimes Mascot who fears change)
- Understand family dynamics (Who has power? Who is silent? Who acts out?)
- Plan follow-up support (Each role needs different kinds of help in recovery)

**Activity** (10 minutes): 'I'm going to describe a family scenario. In your small groups, identify the roles and discuss: How would understanding these roles help you as an interventionist?'

**Scenario**: The Smith Family
- **Tom** (52) drinks heavily every night, has had 2 DUIs, denies problem
- **Lisa** (50, wife) calls in sick for Tom, makes excuses to kids, cooks his meals, does everything to keep family running
- **Alyssa** (23, oldest daughter) got a full scholarship to college, became a lawyer, calls home daily to 'check on mom'
- **Jake** (20, middle son) dropped out of college, got arrested for drug possession, estranged from family
- **Emma** (16, youngest) makes jokes at dinner to lighten the mood, gets good grades but has anxiety

*Give groups 10 minutes to discuss. Then debrief:*
- Tom: Pivot Person
- Lisa: Enabler/Caretaker
- Alyssa: Hero
- Jake: Scapegoat
- Emma: Mascot

*Discuss: How would you work with this family? Who would you invite to intervention? What roles would you expect them to play?*

---

### 1:45-2:15 ‚Äî SYSTEMS MAPPING EXERCISE (30 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY - Family Systems Mapping]**

**Purpose**: Practice visually mapping a family system to identify relationships, communication patterns, and intervention leverage points.

**Materials**: Large paper (flip chart sheets), markers (multiple colors)

**Instructions to Participants**:

"Now we're going to practice **systems mapping** ‚Äî a visual tool for understanding family dynamics.

You'll work in groups of 3-4. I'm going to give you a case scenario (or you can use a real case from your experience, anonymized). Your task:

**Create a family systems map that shows:**
1. **People**: Draw circles for each family member. Put the Pivot Person in the center.
2. **Relationships**: Draw lines between people:
   - Solid line = close, healthy relationship
   - Dotted line = distant or strained
   - Jagged line = conflictual
   - Double line = enmeshed (too close, no boundaries)
3. **Communication patterns**: Use arrows to show who talks to whom
4. **Alliances**: Circle sub-groups (e.g., Mom + older daughter vs. Dad)
5. **Resources**: Outside the family circle, note external supports (therapist, AA, church, friends)

You have 20 minutes. I'll come around to support."

*Provide case scenario or let groups use their own. Circulate. Notice what emerges.*

**Case Scenario Option** (if needed):
"The Martinez Family: Carlos (45) uses cocaine, works in construction, good worker when sober. His wife Rosa (43) has threatened to leave multiple times but hasn't. They have three kids: Miguel (18, about to start college, very close to mom), Sofia (15, barely speaks, spends all time in her room), and Diego (10, class clown, behavior problems at school). Carlos's mother (abuela, 70) lives with them and tells Rosa to be more patient with Carlos. Rosa's sister Maria lives nearby and tells Rosa to leave Carlos. Carlos has two brothers who also drink/use."

**Debrief** (10 minutes, full group):
- "Show us your maps. What patterns did you notice?"
- "Where did you identify leverage points for intervention?"
- "Who would you include in an intervention meeting? Who would you exclude? Why?"
- "What surprised you about mapping the system visually?"

---

### 2:15-2:30 ‚Äî DEBRIEF & TRANSITION TO BREAK (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Integration]**

"Beautiful work. What I noticed in your maps is [name 2-3 themes: isolation of Pivot Person, triangulation, enabling patterns, lost children].

**Key takeaways from this session:**

1. **Families are systems** ‚Äî you can't understand one person in isolation
2. **Roles become rigid in addiction** ‚Äî and everyone needs support to change
3. **The Pivot Person is the symptom bearer** ‚Äî but the whole system needs healing
4. **Systems mapping is a tool** ‚Äî use it to understand dynamics and plan intervention

**This is why we use the term 'Pivot Person'** instead of 'addict' or 'person of concern.' The Pivot Person's struggle creates a **pivot point** for the WHOLE family to turn toward growth. The intervention is as much for the family as it is for the individual.

When we come back from break, we're going to dive into **language** ‚Äî why the words we choose matter, and how to talk about addiction, boundaries, and recovery in ways that reduce shame and increase connection.

**Break: 2:30-2:45 PM (15 minutes)**."

# SESSION 1.5: LANGUAGE WORKSHOP
**Time:** 2:45-4:00 PM (75 minutes)
**Focus:** Learning and practicing Core Values language choices

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why language matters in intervention work
- Practice using "Pivot Person" instead of shaming labels
- Practice using "Healthy Choices" instead of "boundaries"
- Reframe blame-oriented language into systems-oriented language
- Recognize tone as part of language (how we say it matters as much as what we say)

## Materials Needed
- Language reference handout
- Scenario cards for reframing practice
- Flip chart for before/after examples

## Detailed Content & Scripts

### 2:45-3:00 ‚Äî WHY LANGUAGE MATTERS (15 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Language Foundation]**

"Welcome back. We're going to spend the next hour talking about something that might seem small but is actually HUGE: **the words we use**.

**Language shapes reality.**

Think about it: When we call someone an 'addict,' what image comes to mind? *[Pause for responses]* Probably not a person. Probably a collection of behaviors. A problem to be fixed.

When we call someone a 'Pivot Person,' what image comes to mind? *[Pause]* A person. A human being who is at a pivot point. Someone who can turn.

**Language creates connection or distance.**

When a family says: 'We need to set boundaries with him or he'll never change' ‚Äî what's the underlying message? *[Pause]* Control. Protect ourselves FROM him.

When a family says: 'We're making healthy choices for ourselves' ‚Äî what's the underlying message? *[Pause]* Agency. Taking care of ourselves while still loving him.

**As interventionists, we are language stewards.**

The words we choose:
- Reduce or increase shame
- Empower or disempower families
- Create connection or distance
- Model dignity or judgment

**Core Values Recovery has specific language choices**, and you need to know them, practice them, and help families adopt them.

**Why? Because language is intervention.**

When we reframe 'You're enabling him' to 'You've been doing what felt loving, and now you're learning new ways to help' ‚Äî we reduce defensiveness and open the door to change."

---

### 3:00-3:20 ‚Äî CORE VALUES LANGUAGE CHOICES (20 minutes)

**[TEACHING - Language Guide]**

"Let me walk you through the key language choices, and I'll explain the WHY behind each one.

**1. 'PIVOT PERSON' (not 'addict,' 'alcoholic,' 'person of concern,' 'identified patient')**

**Why 'Pivot Person'?**
- Acknowledges that this person's struggle creates a **pivot point** for the whole family to turn toward growth
- Emphasizes shared responsibility and movement
- Humanizes: person first, struggle second
- Invites collaboration, not rescue or blame

**When to use**: Any time you're referring to the individual whose addiction prompted the intervention

**Example**: 'The Pivot Person is invited to participate in this first meeting' (not 'The addict will be surprised')

---

**2. 'HEALTHY CHOICES' (not 'boundaries,' 'consequences,' 'ultimatums')**

**Why 'Healthy Choices'?**
- Places ownership with the person MAKING the choice (empowerment)
- Focuses on what you WILL do, not what the other person CAN'T do
- Language of agency and self-respect, not control
- Reduces the sense of punishment or reaction

**When to use**: When discussing what family members will do to take care of themselves

**Example**:
- ‚ùå 'We're setting a boundary: You can't live here if you're using'
- ‚úÖ 'We're making a healthy choice: We're not willing to have active addiction in our home'

**See the difference?** The first is about controlling the other person. The second is about the family's choice for themselves.

---

**3. 'RECOVERY IS A TEAM SPORT' (not 'co-dependency,' 'family disease')**

**Why?**
- Emphasizes collaboration and shared effort
- Positions recovery as active and collective
- Avoids pathologizing the family ('co-dependent' can feel like a diagnosis)
- Creates energy and hope

**When to use**: When explaining why the whole family needs support

**Example**: 'Recovery is a team sport. Just like the Pivot Person needs a coach, therapist, and peer support, you (family) need family coaching, Al-Anon, and your own recovery plan.'

---

**4. 'INVITATION OVER COERCION' (not 'tough love,' 'making them hit bottom')**

**Why?**
- Centers dignity and respect
- Acknowledges that lasting change comes from within, not from force
- Allows for structure when necessary (invitation as PRIMARY, structure as NECESSARY)
- Reduces shame

**When to use**: When explaining Core Values philosophy to families

**Example**: 'We lead with invitation. We believe people are more likely to engage in recovery when they feel respected and offered choice. That said, sometimes structure is necessary to create safety.'

---

**5. 'WE'VE BEEN HELPING IN THE WRONG WAYS' (not 'you're enabling,' 'you're the problem')**

**Why?**
- Reduces defensiveness by using inclusive language ('we')
- Acknowledges good intentions
- Creates curiosity instead of shame
- Opens door to learning new behaviors

**When to use**: When educating families about enabling

**Example**:
- ‚ùå 'You've been enabling him by paying his bills'
- ‚úÖ 'We've all been doing what felt loving ‚Äî covering bills, making excuses, protecting from consequences. And we're learning that those actions, while well-intentioned, have made it easier for the disease to continue.'

---

**6. PERSON-FIRST LANGUAGE (not labels)**

**Why?**
- Reduces dehumanization
- Separates the person from the behavior
- Maintains dignity

**Examples**:
- ‚ùå 'He's an addict'
- ‚úÖ 'He's a person struggling with addiction'
- ‚ùå 'She's a drunk'
- ‚úÖ 'She has alcohol use disorder'

**Note**: Some people in recovery self-identify as 'addict' or 'alcoholic' (especially in 12-step culture). Honor their self-identification. But as professionals, we default to person-first language."

---

### 3:20-3:50 ‚Äî REFRAMING EXERCISE (30 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY - Language Reframing Practice]**

**Purpose**: Practice reframing blame-oriented or shaming language into Core Values language.

**Setup**: Small groups of 3-4 people. Provide scenario cards.

**Instructions to Participants**:

"Now you're going to practice reframing. I'm going to give you a series of statements that families commonly say ‚Äî or that interventionists might say without thinking. Your job:

1. **Identify** what's problematic about the language
2. **Reframe** using Core Values language choices
3. **Practice** saying it out loud (tone matters!)

You'll have 20 minutes to work through the scenarios. Then we'll share as a full group."

**SCENARIO CARDS** (print and cut):

**Scenario 1**:
Family member says: "We've tried everything. He's just a selfish addict who doesn't care about anyone but himself."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

**Scenario 2**:
Interventionist says to family: "You need to stop enabling him or he'll never get better. You're part of the problem."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

**Scenario 3**:
Family member says: "We're setting a boundary: If he doesn't go to treatment today, he's not welcome in our lives anymore."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

**Scenario 4**:
Therapist says to Pivot Person: "You're in denial. You need to admit you're an alcoholic."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

**Scenario 5**:
Family member says: "Why should we go to Al-Anon? He's the one with the problem, not us."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

**Scenario 6**:
Interventionist says: "We're going to make him hit bottom so he has to get help."
- What's problematic?
- How would you reframe?

*Circulate among groups. Listen. Offer guidance. After 20 minutes:*

**Debrief** (10 minutes, full group):

Go through each scenario. Ask for volunteers to share their reframes. Affirm good reframes. Offer alternatives.

**Sample Reframes** (for facilitator reference):

**Scenario 1 Reframe**:
"It sounds like you're exhausted and scared. What you're seeing is the disease of addiction, which hijacks the brain and makes it hard for him to see clearly or prioritize relationships. That doesn't mean he doesn't care ‚Äî it means his brain is sick. And there's hope."

**Scenario 2 Reframe**:
"What you've been doing has come from a place of love ‚Äî trying to protect him, keep the family together. And what I'm learning is that sometimes those loving actions unintentionally make it easier for the disease to continue. I'm here to help you learn new ways to help that actually work."

**Scenario 3 Reframe**:
"It sounds like you're making a healthy choice for yourselves ‚Äî you're not willing to have active addiction in your lives. That's powerful. Let's make sure he understands that the door to relationship is always open once recovery begins, but you're protecting yourselves right now."

**Scenario 4 Reframe**:
"I'm noticing there's a gap between how you see your drinking and how others see it. That gap is worth exploring. What do you make of the fact that people you love are worried?"

**Scenario 5 Reframe**:
"That's a fair question. Here's what we've learned: addiction affects everyone in the family. Even if you're not the one using, you've been living with the stress, fear, and chaos. Al-Anon isn't about fixing him ‚Äî it's about YOUR recovery. You deserve support too."

**Scenario 6 Reframe**:
"Actually, we're not going to 'make him hit bottom.' Research shows that interventions can raise the bottom ‚Äî help someone see reality sooner without waiting for devastating consequences. Our approach is about creating awareness and offering help with dignity."

---

### 3:50-4:00 ‚Äî INTEGRATION (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Language Summary]**

"Great work. I heard some beautiful reframes ‚Äî especially [name 2-3 examples].

**Key takeaways from this session:**

1. **Language shapes reality** ‚Äî words create connection or distance
2. **Core Values language choices**:
   - Pivot Person (not addict)
   - Healthy Choices (not boundaries)
   - Recovery is a Team Sport (not co-dependency)
   - Invitation over Coercion (not tough love)
   - We've been helping in the wrong ways (not you're enabling)
3. **Tone matters as much as words** ‚Äî practice saying it with warmth
4. **This takes practice** ‚Äî you'll stumble, and that's okay. Keep coming back to dignity and respect.

**Your homework tonight** (if you want): Pay attention to the language you use when you talk about addiction or recovery. Notice when you slip into old patterns. Practice reframing.

Now, our final session of Day 1: **Reflection & Integration**. This is where we slow down, process, and prepare for Day 2."

- Identify personal insights and questions
- Build group cohesion through closing circle
- Preview Day 2 content

## Materials Needed
- Journals or reflection worksheets
- Closing circle format
- Day 2 preview slides

## Detailed Content & Scripts

### 4:00-4:25 ‚Äî JOURNALING / SILENT REFLECTION (25 minutes)

**[ACTIVITY - Reflection]**

**Purpose**: Create space for participants to process Day 1 emotionally and cognitively before leaving.

**Instructions to Participants**:

"We've covered a lot today. Before we close, I want to give you time to reflect silently.

I'm going to give you three reflection prompts. You can write, draw, or just sit with them. There's no right way to do this. This is for YOU.

Find a comfortable spot ‚Äî you can stay in your seat, move to a corner, even step outside if you need fresh air. We'll come back together in 20 minutes for closing circle.

**Reflection Prompts** (write on flip chart or slide):

1. **What surprised you today?** (What did you learn that you didn't expect?)

2. **What challenged you?** (What felt uncomfortable or difficult?)

3. **What are you taking with you?** (What idea, insight, or commitment will you carry forward?)

You have 20 minutes. See you back here at [time]."

*Facilitator: Honor this silence. Don't fill it. Let people process. Some will write. Some will stare. Some may need to step out. After 20 minutes, gently call people back:*

---

### 4:25-4:50 ‚Äî CLOSING CIRCLE (25 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Closing Circle]**

"Welcome back. Let's come together in a circle for our closing.

In this closing circle, we're going to practice something you'll do with families: **holding space for multiple truths at once.**

Recovery is complicated. Intervention is complicated. Families hold love and resentment, hope and exhaustion, all at the same time. And that's okay.

Here's how this will work:

**I'll invite anyone who wants to share to speak.** You can share:
- One word
- One sentence
- One insight from your reflection
- A question that's still alive for you
- Or simply say 'pass'

**Guidelines:**
- Speak from 'I' (your own experience)
- No crosstalk (don't respond to others, just listen)
- Hold silence between shares (let each person's words land)

I'll start: **Today reminded me why I do this work. It's messy, it's complicated, and it matters deeply.**

*Pause. Let silence settle. Then:*

"Who would like to share?"

*Facilitate circle sharing. 15-20 minutes. Listen deeply. Don't comment on every share ‚Äî let them stand on their own. After everyone who wants to share has spoken:*

"Thank you for your honesty and presence today. What I'm hearing is [name themes: curiosity, challenge, hope, commitment, questions]. All of that is welcome here."

### 4:50-5:00 ‚Äî DAY 2 PREVIEW & HOMEWORK (10 minutes)

**[FACILITATION SCRIPT - Preview]**

"Before we close for today, let me give you a preview of tomorrow.

**Day 2: COORDINATION ‚Äî The Architecture of Care**

Tomorrow, we're going to:
- Dive deep into **roles and boundaries** (Interventionist vs. Coach vs. Therapist vs. Sponsor)
- Learn the **Intervention Continuum** ‚Äî the signature Core Values framework (5 intervention modes, how to choose, how to adapt)
- Explore **tools of intervention** (communication strategies, assessment, planning)
- Set up a **family case study** that we'll roleplay on Day 3

**Tomorrow is dense.** It's the most content-heavy day. We'll be learning frameworks, practicing assessments, and preparing for Day 3's simulation.

**Homework** (optional but encouraged):
1. **Read** the section in your workbook on 'Roles and Boundaries' (pages 15-22)
2. **Reflect** on this question: 'What role do I naturally gravitate toward in family systems? (Rescuer? Fixer? Observer? Organizer?)' Self-awareness will help tomorrow.
3. **Rest** ‚Äî we covered a lot today. Give yourself space to process.

**Logistics for Tomorrow:**
- Same time: 9:00 AM start
- We'll have a working lunch (sandwiches provided) so we can keep momentum during the Intervention Continuum module
- Bring questions

Any final questions before we close?"

*Address questions.*

"Thank you for your engagement, your vulnerability, and your commitment today. See you tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

**Day 1 complete. Rest well.**"
