## Project Overview

**Coaching 101: Core Values Foundations for Recovery Coaches**

2. **Participant Manual (Workbook)** - Learner guide with reflection exercises and case studies
3. **Three-Day Training Schedule** - Hour-by-hour curriculum across 21 contact hours

- **Tone:** Minimalist, values-based, dignified, experiential over lecture-based

- **Texas:** CORE + 250-hour supervision

Include state pathway information in appendices and Day 3 certification briefing.

## Content Development Guidelines

1. **Experiential focus** - Prioritize activities, roleplays, and reflection over lectures
2. **Safety in vulnerability** - Include proper debrief protocols for sensitive content
3. **Elicit vs. tell** - Design prompts that draw out participant insight rather than deliver information
4. **Scope differentiation** - Clearly distinguish peer coaching from therapy, clinical work, and sponsorship
5. **Gray-area ethics** - Include realistic dilemmas without clear right answers for discussion
6. **Action-oriented** - Every module should lead to practical application and next steps

## When Creating New Materials

- Reference the requirements packet: `Coaching_101_Requirements_Packet.md`
- Maintain alignment with 21-hour total contact time
- Use placeholders for quotes, illustrations, and diagrams when layout isn't final
- Return drafts in Markdown or Word before final PDF layout
- Preserve the Core Values Recovery brand voice throughout all materials
