# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains both **web applications** and **training content** for three Core Values Recovery professional development programs:

1. **Coaching 101** - Core Values Foundations for Recovery Coaches (3 days, 21 hours)
2. **Intervention Training** - Advanced Crisis Intervention Professional Development (3 days + 40-week mentorship)
3. **Family Recovery Coach Training** - Family Systems Recovery Coaching (3 days)

All programs use the Core Values Recovery framework, bridging state Peer Support Specialist and CCAR Recovery Coach Academy curricula with an experiential, values-driven approach.

### Working with Applications vs Content

**When working on web applications:**
- All app code is in `apps/` directory
- Shared resources (CSS, JS, images) are in `apps/shared/`
- Backend server is in `apps/server/`
- Module-specific code is in respective app directories

**When working on training content:**
- All content is in `content/` directory organized by course
- Manuals are separated from schedules and other materials
- Use the appropriate subdirectory based on content type

## Core Deliverables (All Programs)

1. **Facilitator Manuals** - Complete lesson plans, scripts, and materials for trainers
2. **Participant Manuals (Workbooks)** - Learner guides with reflection exercises and case studies
3. **Training Schedules** - Hour-by-hour curriculum for each program
4. **Digital Learning Platform** - Interactive web applications for each training program

## Brand & Design Standards

- **Tone:** Minimalist, values-based, dignified, experiential over lecture-based
- **Version headers** required on every page

## Key Philosophical Frameworks

When creating content, incorporate these Core Values Recovery concepts:

- **"Guide not Guru"** - Coaching stance vs. directive advice-giving

- **Texas:** CORE + 250-hour supervision

Include state pathway information in appendices and Day 3 certification briefing.

## Content Development Guidelines

1. **Experiential focus** - Prioritize activities, roleplays, and reflection over lectures
2. **Safety in vulnerability** - Include proper debrief protocols for sensitive content
3. **Elicit vs. tell** - Design prompts that draw out participant insight rather than deliver information
4. **Scope differentiation** - Clearly distinguish peer coaching from therapy, clinical work, and sponsorship
5. **Gray-area ethics** - Include realistic dilemmas without clear right answers for discussion
6. **Action-oriented** - Every module should lead to practical application and next steps

## When Creating New Materials

node scripts/generate-manual.js coaching101
node scripts/generate-manual.js intervention
node scripts/generate-manual.js families
```

## Adding a New Course

### Quick Method: Use the Script

The easiest way to add a new course is to use the automated script:

```bash
./scripts/create-course.sh <course-id> "<course-name>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/create-course.sh executive "Executive Recovery Coaching"
```

This script will:
- âœ… Create all necessary directories (apps and content)
- âœ… Generate a basic web app template
- âœ… Register the module in the database
- âœ… Add the server route
- âœ… Create placeholder README files for content

After running the script:
1. Restart the server: `npm start`
2. Visit your new course at: `http://localhost:3000/<course-id>`
3. Customize the web app in `apps/<course-id>/index.html`
4. Add training materials to `content/<course-id>/`

### Manual Method: Step-by-Step

If you prefer to add a new training course manually (e.g., "Executive Coaching"), follow these steps:

### 1. Create Directory Structure

Create the following directories:

```bash
# Application directories
mkdir -p apps/[course-id]
mkdir -p apps/[course-id]/content  # if using content modules

# Content directories
mkdir -p content/[course-id]/manuals
mkdir -p content/[course-id]/schedules
mkdir -p content/[course-id]/other
```

Example for "Executive Coaching" (course-id: `executive`):
```bash
mkdir -p apps/executive
mkdir -p content/executive/{manuals,schedules,other}
```

### 2. Register Module in Database

Edit `apps/server/db.js` and add your module to the `modules` array (around line 79):

```javascript
const modules = [
    { id: 'coaching101', name: 'Coaching 101' },
    { id: 'families', name: 'Family Recovery Coach Training' },
    { id: 'intervention', name: 'Intervention Skill Lab' },
    { id: 'executive', name: 'Executive Recovery Coaching' }  // NEW
];
```

### 3. Add Server Route

Edit `apps/server/index.js` and add a route for your module (around line 467):

```javascript
app.get('/executive', (req, res) => {
    return res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../executive/index.html'));
});
```

### 4. Create Web App Files

Create these files in `apps/[course-id]/`:

**Minimum required:**
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
  - Reference shared CSS: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../shared/styles.css">`
  - Reference shared JS: `<script src="../shared/apiClient.js"></script>` and `<script src="../shared/app.js"></script>`
  - Set moduleId: `window.CORE_VALUES_CONFIG = { moduleId: '[course-id]' };`
- Optional: `content.js` - Course-specific content
- Optional: `styles.css` - Course-specific styles

**Copy/modify from existing module:**
The easiest approach is to copy an existing module's files and modify them:
```bash
cp apps/coaching101/index.html apps/executive/index.html
# Then edit to customize content
```

### 5. Create Content Files

Add training materials in `content/[course-id]/`:

**Manuals directory:**
- Facilitator manuals (`.md` or `.docx`)
- Participant manuals/workbooks
- If complex like intervention, use subdirectories: `consolidated/`, `modular/`, `guides/`

**Schedules directory:**
- `Day1_Schedule.md`, `Day2_Schedule.md`, etc.
- `Quick_Reference_Schedule.md`

**Other directory:**
- Training overviews
- Requirements packets
- Supporting documents

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md (Optional)

Add a section for your new course in CLAUDE.md with:
- Course description and duration
- Training structure overview
- Any course-specific guidelines

### Example: Complete New Course Setup

```bash
# 1. Create directories
mkdir -p apps/executive content/executive/{manuals,schedules,other}

# 2. Copy template files from existing course
cp apps/coaching101/index.html apps/executive/index.html

# 3. Edit apps/executive/index.html
#    - Change title, heading, moduleId
#    - Customize content sections

# 4. Add module to apps/server/db.js
#    Add: { id: 'executive', name: 'Executive Recovery Coaching' }

# 5. Add route to apps/server/index.js
#    Add: app.get('/executive', (req, res) => {...});

# 6. Create content files
#    Add manuals, schedules to content/executive/

# 7. Restart server
npm start

# 8. Access at http://localhost:3000/executive
```

### Current Limitations & Potential Improvements

**Current system requires manual changes for each new course:**
1. Hardcoded routes in `apps/server/index.js`
2. Hardcoded modules in `apps/server/db.js`

**Potential improvements for easier course creation:**
1. **Dynamic module loading** - Read from a `courses.json` config file
2. **Course template generator** - Script to scaffold new course structure
3. **Auto-discovery** - Server automatically detects apps/[course-id] directories
4. **Module metadata** - Store course info (duration, prerequisites, etc.) in database

If you're planning to add many courses, consider refactoring to use a configuration-driven approach.
